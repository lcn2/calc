/*
 * banned - optionally ban dangerous functions
 *
 * Unless UNBAN is defined, this file will turn the use
 * of certain dangerous functions into syntax errors.
 *
 * In the case of calc, we are motivated in part by the desire for
 * calc to correctly calculate: even during extremely long calculations.
 *
 * If UNBAN is NOT defined, then calling certain functions
 * will result in a syntax error.
 *
 * If we define UNBAN, then the effect of this file is disabled.
 *
 * The banned.h attempts to ban the use of certain dangerous functions
 * that, if improperly used, could compromise the computational integrity
 * if calculations.
 *
 * In the case of calc, we are motivated in part by the desire for calc
 * to correctly calculate: even during extremely long calculations.
 *
 * If UNBAN is NOT defined, then calling certain functions
 * will result in a call to a non-existent function (link error).
 *
 * While we do NOT encourage defining UNBAN, there may be
 * a system / compiler environment where re-defining a
 * function may lead to a fatal compiler complication.
 * If that happens, consider compiling as:
 *
 *      make clobber all chk CCBAN=-DUNBAN
 *
 * as see if this is a work-a-round.
 *
 * If YOU discover a need for the -DUNBAN work-a-round, PLEASE tell us!
 * Please send us a bug report.  See the file:
 *
 *      BUGS
 *
 * or the URL:
 *
 *      http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/calc/calc-bugrept.html
 *
 * for how to send us such a bug report.

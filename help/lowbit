NAME
    lowbit - index of lowest nonzero bit in binary representation of integer

SYNOPSIS
    lowbit(x)

TYPES
    x           nonzero integer

    return      integer

DESCRIPTION
    If x is a nonzero integer, lowbit(x) returns the index of the
    lowest nonzero bit in the binary representation of abs(x).  Equivalently,
    lowbit(x) is the greatest integer for which x/2^n is an integer;
    the binary representation of x then ends with n zero bits.

EXAMPLE
    ; print lowbit(2), lowbit(3), lowbit(4), lowbit(-15), lowbit(2^27)
    1 0 2 0 27

LIMITS
    none

LINK LIBRARY
    long zlowbit(ZVALUE x);

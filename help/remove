NAME
    remove - remove the last member of a list

SYNOPSIS
    remove(lst)

TYPES
    lst         lvalue whose current value is a list

    return      any

DESCRIPTION
    If lst has no members, remove(lst) returns the null value and does
    not change lst.

    If lst has n members where n > 0, remove(lst) returns the value of
    lst[[n-1]] and deletes this value from the end of the lst, so that
    lst now has n - 1 members and for 0 <= i < n - 1, lst[[i]] returns
    what it would have returned before the remove operation.

EXAMPLE
    ; lst = list(2,"three")

    list (2 elements, 2 nonzero):
      [[0]] = 2
      [[1]] = "three"

    ; remove(lst)
            "three"
    ; print lst

    list (1 elements, 1 nonzero):
      [[0]] = 2

    ; remove(lst)
            2
    ; print lst
    list (0 elements, 0 nonzero)
    ; remove(lst)
    ; print lst
    list (0 elements, 0 nonzero)

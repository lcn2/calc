SYNOPSIS
    arg(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x		number
    eps		nonzero real, defaults to epsilon()

    return	real

DESCRIPTION
    Returns the argument of x to the nearest or next to nearest multiple of
    eps; the error will be less in absolute value than 0.75 * abs(eps),
    but usually less than 0.5 * abs(eps).

EXAMPLE
    > print arg(2), arg(2+3i, 1e-5), arg(2+3i, 1e-10), arg(2+3i, 1e-20)
    0 .98279 .9827937232 .98279372324732906799

    > pi = pi(1e-10); deg = pi/180; eps = deg/10000
    > print arg(2+3i, eps)/deg, arg(-1 +1i, eps)/deg, arg(-1 - 1i,eps)/deg

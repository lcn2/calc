NAME
    argv - count or value of a calc command line supplied argument

SYNOPSIS
    argv([n])

TYPES
    n		nonnegative integer

    return	any

DESCRIPTION
    Without args, this builtin returns the number of calc command line
    strings available, including the program or script name.

    If the numeric arg is supplied, then the corresponding command line
    string is return, if it exists.  Otherwise a nul() value is returned.

    In keeping with the argc/argv convention of C, argv(0) will refer
    to the name of the program.  If the -f filename argument is used,
    then argv(0) will refer to the filename.  In the case of a #! script,
    assuming the calc is located in /usr/local/bin/calc, the first
    line of a calc script would be:

	#!/usr/local/bin/calc -f
	...

    then argv(0) will refer to the filename of the script.

    As it is common to use -q in a calc script, and using that same
    /usr/local/bin/calc location:

	#!/usr/local/bin/calc -q -f
	...

    and again, argv(0) will refer to the filename of the script.

    The 1st argument to calc will be argv(1), and argv(argv()-1)
    will refer to the last.  This differs from the way the param()
    builtin works.

    By default, calc will evaluate all of its command line arguments.
    However, if calc is invoked with -s, all non-dashed options will
    be left as unevaluated strings.  Thus:

	calc -i 2+2

    will cause calc to print 4 and enter interactive mode.  In this case
    argv() will return 1.

    On the other hand:

	calc -i -s 2+2

    will cause calc to interactive mode.  The argv() builtin will return 2
    and argv(1) will return the string "2+2".

EXAMPLE
    $ calc -s a bb ccc
    ; argc = argv();
    ; print "argc =", argc;
    argc = 4
    ; print 'argv[0] = "': argv(0) : '"';
    argv[0] = "calc"
    ; for (i = 1; i < argc; i++) print "argv[": i : '] = "': argv(i) : '"';
    argv[1] = "a"
    argv[2] = "bb"
    argv[3] = "ccc"

LIMITS
    0 <= n < 2^31

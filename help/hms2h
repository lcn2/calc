NAME
    hm2h, hms2h - convert hours, minutes, and seconds to hours

SYNOPSIS
    hm2h(h, m [,rnd])
    hms2h(h, m, s [,rnd])

TYPES
    h           real
    m           real
    s           real (defaults to 0)
    rnd         nonnegative integer, defaults to config("mod")

    return      hours

DESCRIPTION
    Convert hours, m minutes, and s seconds returning hours.

    The return value in hours, is equivalent to the following:

        mod(h + m/60 + s/3600, 24, rnd);

    Depending on the rounding mode, the return could be a real value
    in the interval [0, 24) or a real value in the interval (-24, 0].
    For the default round mode, the return value is in the interval [0, 24).

    A missing rnd defaults to config("mod").
    For more information on the effects of rnd, see "help mod".

    The hm2h(h, m, rnd) builtin is an alias for hms2h(h, m, 0, rnd).

EXAMPLE
    ; print hm2h(203, 325.5594);
    16.42599
    ; print hm2h(241, -25.5594);
    0.57401
    ; print hm2h(-923, -25.5594);
    12.57401

    ; print hms2h(12, 20, 44.16);
    12.3456
    ; print hms2h(123.456, -345.68, 4.08);
    21.6958
    ; print hms2h(-65, -40, -44.4);
    6.321

    ; print hm2h(203, 325.5594, 1);
    -7.57401

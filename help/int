NAME
    int - return the integer part of a number or of numbers in a value

SYNOPSIS
    int(x)

TYPES
    If x is an object of type xx, int(x) requires xx_int to have been
    defined; other conditions on x and the value returned depend on
    the definition of xx_int.

    For other x:

    x		number (real or complex), matrix

    return	number or matrix

DESCRIPTION
    If x is an integer, int(x) returns x.  For other real values of x,
    int(x) returns the value of i for which x = i + f, where i is an
    integer, sgn(f) = sgn(x) and abs(f) < 1.

    If x is complex, int(x) returns int(re(x)) + int(im(x))*1i.

    If x is a matrix, int(x) returns the matrix m with the same structure
    as x in which m[[i]] = int(x[[i]]).

EXAMPLE
    > print int(3), int(22/7), int(27/7), int(-3.125), int(2.15 - 3.25i)
    3 3 3 -3 2-3i

LIMITS
    none

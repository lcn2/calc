NAME
    inputlevel - current input level

SYNOPSIS
    inputlevel()

TYPES
    return	nonnegative integer

DESCRIPTION
    This function returns the input level at which it is called.
    When calc starts, it is at level zero.  The level is increased
    by 1 each time execution starts of a read file command or a call to
    eval(S) for some expression S which evaluates to a string.	It
    decreases by 1 when a file being read reaches EOF or a string
    being eval-ed reaches '\0', or earlier if a quit statement is
    encountered at top calculation-level in the flle or string.	 It
    decreases to zero if an abort statement is encountered at any
    function-level in the file or string.  If a quit or abort
    statement is encountered at top calculation-level at top input-level,
    calc is exited.

    Zero input level is also called top input level; greater values
    of inputlevel() indicate reading at greater depths.

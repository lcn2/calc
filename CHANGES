The following are the changes from calc version 2.14.2.3 to date:

    Fixed missing <string.h include in have_fpos_pos.c.

    Change calc version from 2.14.1.2 to 2.14.2.3 as part of a test to
    build calc RPMs on a reference RHEL8.7 platform (formerly a RHEL7.9
    platform).

    Changes #! lines in Makefiles to "#!/usr/bin/env make".

    Set SHELL in Makefiles to the basename of the shell.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.14.2.0 to 2.14.1.2:

    Attempted to address a paranoid compiler warning -Wmaybe-uninitialized
    in swap_HALF_in_ZVALUE() where the gcc compiler seems to ignore the
    fact that calling not_reached() above the call to zcopyval()
    should prevent dest from being NULL to the 1st zcopyval() call.
    Thanks to <GitHub user mattdm> for raising this potential concern.

    Fixed a -Wuse-after-free warning that identified a call to realloc()
    in find_tty_state() could move the fd_setup array.  Thanks goes to
    <GitHub user mattdm> for reporting this bug!

    In find_tty_state(), we changed how we expand fd_orig as an original
    pre-modified copy of fd_setup.  We realloc the fd_orig array and copy
    the fd_setup into it first, before touching the fd_setup array.

    In pseudo_seed(), we removed a call to setjmp() that was only
    there to add more information to mix into the seed.  For compilers
    such as gcc that used -Wclobbered, the call to setjmp() gave the
    impression that the hash_val might be clobbered by a longjmp().
    Where there is no longjmp() that would use the previous setjmp(),
    the gcc compiler has nil ways to notice that. So to avoid confusion
    we removed the setjmp() call.  Thanks to <GitHub user mattdm> for
    raising this potential concern.

    Added config("tilde_space", boolean).  The "tilde_space" controls
    whether or not a space (' ') is printed after leading tilde ('~').
    By default, config("tilde_space") is false.

    For example, with the default, config("tilde_space", 0):

	; 1/3
		~0.33333333333333333333
	; sqrt(7 + 5i,1e-100)
		~2.79305614578749801863+~0.89507688693280053094i

    With config("tilde_space", 1):

	; 1/3
		~ 0.33333333333333333333
	; sqrt(7 + 5i,1e-100)
		~ 2.79305614578749801863+~ 0.89507688693280053094i

    NOTE: Use of config("tilde_space", 1) can break printing and scanning
	  of complex values via "%c".

    To enable "tilde_space", use config("tilde_space", 1) on the
    command line and/or use config("tilde_space", 1),; in your ~/.calcrc.
    Thanks goes to <GitHub use ljramalho> for this suggestion.

    Added config("tilde_space", boolean) to help/config, along with
    a few few minor text improvements.  Updated cal/regress to test
    config("tilde_space").

    For example, with the default, config("tilde_space", 0):

	; pi(1e-50)
		~3.14159265358979323846

    With config("tilde_space", 1):

	; pi(1e-50)
		~ 3.14159265358979323846

    Added config("fraction_space", boolean).  The "fraction_space" controls
    whether or not a space (' ') is printed before and after fractions.
    By default, config("fraction_space") is false.

    For example, with the default, config("fraction_space", 0):

	; base(1/3),
	; 1/7
		1/7

    With config("fraction_space", 1):

	; base(1/3),
	; 1/7
		1 / 7

    NOTE: Use of config("fraction_space", 1) can break printing and scanning
	  of fractional values via "%r".

    NOTE: Use of config("fraction_space", 1) can break printing and scanning
	  of complex values via "%c".

    Added config("fraction_space", boolean) to help/config, along with
    a few few minor text improvements.  Updated cal/regress to test
    config("tilde_space").

    Added config("complex_space", boolean).  The "complex_space" controls
    whether or not a space (' ') is printed before and after the + or -
    in complex values.

    By default, config("complex_space") is false.

    For example, with the default, config("complex_space", 0):

	; asin(2)
		1.57079632679489661923-1.31695789692481670863i

    With config("complex_space", 1):

	; asin(2)
		1.57079632679489661923 - 1.31695789692481670863i

    NOTE: Use of config("complex_space", 1) can break printing and scanning
	  of fractional values via "%r".

    NOTE: Use of config("complex_space", 1) can break printing and scanning
	  of complex values via "%c".

    Added config("complex_space", boolean) to help/config, along with
    a few few minor text improvements.  Updated cal/regress to test
    config("complex_space").

    Clarify in the calc man page, the relationship between -q and
    calc start scripts such as the ~/.calcrc file.

    Fixed in the calc man page, the issue of -f not implying -q.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.14.1.2 to date:

    Restored use of the #define FPOS_POS_LEN symbol.  This refers to
    the length of the __pos element (if the __pos element exists),
    the fpos_t type (if that type exists).

    Changed SWAP_HALF_IN_FILEPOS(dest, src) mato to use FILEPOS_LEN Little
    Endian when FILEPOS is a simple scalar type (i.e., HAVE_FILEPOS_SCALAR
    is defined).

    Changed #define HAVE_FPOS to HAVE_FGETSETPOS.

    Corrected comment in have_fpos_pos.h.  The HAVE_FPOS_POS symbol was
    NOT related to fgetpos & fsetpos but rather if we we have an __pos
    element in FILEPOS.

    Changed #define HAVE_NO_FPOS to HAVE_NO_FGETSETPOS.

    Improved comments in have_fpos_pos.h to show why and how
    HAVE_FPOS_POS, FPOS_POS_BITS, and FPOS_POS_LEN were defined or undefed.

    Changed showfiles builtin to print sizes cast to (long int) with
    the "%ld" printf format to avoid implementations that do not support
    the "%lld" printf format specifier.

    Renamed have_fpos.h to have_fgetsetpos.h.  Renamed CALC_HAVE_FPOS_H
    to CALC_HAVE_FGETSETPOS_H.  The make install and the olduninstall
    rules remove the any old have_fpos.h that was previously installed.

    Added swap_HALFs(dest, src, len) function to byteswap.c.

    Calc can now handle Big Engian file position sizes that are a
    multiple of BASEB bits in length.  Before handle Big Engian file
    positions could only be 32 and 64 bits in length.  This will allow,
    for example, a Big Engian file position size of 128 (assuming that
    128/BASEB is is an integer).

    Temporary workaround for musl libc systems such as gentoo Linux that
    allows them to compile calc and successfully run the regression test.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.14.1.1 to 2.14.1.1:

    Added a few remarks on calc version numbers to version.c.

    Fixed how fposval.h is built.  On a number of systems, the fposval.c
    file failed to compile incorrectly.  This caused problems for systems in
    which fposval.h.def was not correct.

    Fixed how have_memmv.h is built.  On a number of systems, the have_memmv.c
    file failed to compile incorrectly, producing a potentially incorrect
    have_memmv.h file for such systems.

    Fixed how align32.h is built.  On a number of systems, the align32.c
    file failed to compile incorrectly, producing a potentially incorrect
    align32.h file for such systems.

    Fixed how have_newstr.h is built.  On a number of systems, the have_newstr.c
    failed to compile incorrectly, producing a potentially incorrect
    have_newstr.h file for such systems.

    Fixed how have_strdup.h is built.  On a number of systems, the have_strdup.c
    file failed to compile incorrectly, producing a potentially incorrect
    have_strdup.h file for such systems.

    Fixed how have_strlcat.h is built.  On a number of systems, the have_strlcat.c
    file failed to compile incorrectly, producing a potentially incorrect
    have_strlcat.h file for such systems.

    Fixed how have_strlcpy.h is built.  On a number of systems, the have_strlcpy.c
    file failed to compile incorrectly, producing a potentially incorrect
    have_strlcpy.h file for such systems.

    Fixed how have_uid_t.h is built.  On a number of systems, the have_uid_t.c
    file failed to compile incorrectly, producing a potentially incorrect
    have_uid_t.h file for such systems.

    Fixed how have_uid_t.h is built.  On a number of systems, the have_uid_t.c
    file failed to compile incorrectly, producing a potentially incorrect
    have_uid_t.h file for such systems.

    Added full_debug rule to Makefile.  This does the work of the
    old debug rule in a more verbose mode by using Q= H=@ S= E= V=@.

    The debug rule in the Makefile now pre-removes debug.out and then
    runs make full_debug sending stdout and stderr to debug.out.  It then
    prints a few instructions about filing a GitHub issue bug report.

    The full_debug rule will no longer stop when one of the sub-tasks
    failed (exit non-zero).


The following are the changes from calc version 2.14.1.0 to 2.14.1.0:

    Fixed alignment of show item section of help command.

    Bug fix: While 0^0 == 1, now for y > 0, 0^y == 0.
    Adjusted cal/test8900.cal to reflect this bug fix.
    Added tests to cal/regress.cal to help verify bug fix is fixed.

    Fixed a \-escape bug in calc(1) man page.

    Added cal/comma.cal:

	Convert numbers into strings with 3-digit group and integer-fraction
	separators.

	If the value is an integer, the integer-fraction separator is not used.

	str_comma(x, [group, [decimal]])

	    Convert x into a string.

	    If group is given and is a string, group will be used as
	    the 3-digit group separator, otherwise the default 3-digit
	    group separator will be used.

	    If decimal is given and is a string, group will be used as
	    the integer-fraction separator, otherwise the default
	    integer-fraction separator will be used.

	    The decimal and group arguments are optional.

	set_default_group_separator(group)

	    Change the default 3-digit group separator if group is a string,
	    otherwise the default 3-digit group separator will not be
	    changed.  Return the old 3-digit group separator.

	set_default_decimal_separator(decimal)

	    Change the default 3-digit group separator if decimal is a
	    string, otherwise the default integer-fraction separator
	    will not be changed.  Return the old integer-fraction separator.

	print_comma(x, [group, [decimal]])

	    Print the value produced by str_comma(x, [group, [decimal]])
	    followed by a newline.

	    If the str_comma() does not return a string, nothing is printed.

	    The decimal and group arguments are optional.

	    The value produced by str_comma() is returned.

	fprint_comma(fd, x, [group, [decimal]])

	    Print the value produced by str_comma(x, [group, [decimal]]),
	    without a trailing newline, on file fd.

	    If the str_comma() does not return a string, nothing is printed.

	    If fd is not an open file, nothing is printed.

	    The decimal and group arguments are optional.

	    The value produced by str_comma() is returned.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.14.0.15 to 2.14.0.15:

    Changed Makefile to set shell before setting the SHELL Makefile
    variable.

    Added text to HOWTO.INSTALL to help people with systems that
    lack the readline package.

    Trimmed long line in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.

    Expanded the globalsymbol string table size: from 1024 to 65536.

    Expanded the how often to reallocate string table is performed:
    from 100 to 1024.

    Expanded the number env_pool elements to allocate at a time:
    from 10 to 256.

    Improve comments on Makefile.local and add a few more examples
    of how it might be used.

    Changed /*NOTREACHED*/ to not_reached(); and use "attribute.h".

    Added .PHONY rule, just after all rule, to Makefiles.

    Made minor format update on help/commands.

    Added ${WINGM} Makefile variable for users under Windows 11 who
    use Cygwin and the MinGW64 packages.

    Updated README.WINDOWS for Windows 11 users based on advice
    form a Microsoft 11 developer.

    Fixed missing quotes in the PASSDOWN makefile variables.

    Disable use of gettime() under _WIN32 or _WIN64.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.14.0.14 to 2.14.0.14:

    Fixed typo in Makefile.local comment.

    Established a tagging procedure for a production release.
    Production git tags will be of the form:

	prod-2.x.y.z


The following are the changes from calc version 2.14.0.13 to 2.14.0.13:

    Made major changes to our release process in order to avoid
    missing critical files that happened in calc v2.4.0.12.

    Minor tweak to seed() builtin.  Updated help/srand and help/srandom.

    Moved Makefile.ship into Makefile.

    Removed custom/Makefile.head and custom/Makefile.tail.

    The custom/Makefile is now part of source and includes Makefile.
    In particular, custom/Makefile makes use of the 'middle' of
    the new top level Makefile where calc's top level Makefile
    variables are defined.

    Makefile.simple and custom/Makefile.simple are now part of the source
    and are constructed from Makefile and custom/Makefile respectively.
    The Makefile.simple and custom/Makefile.simple avoid using GNU
    conditionals. They may be used with older/classic make commands.

    Makefile.local will include comments about how to better use
    it. Between releases, Makefile.local at the top of the master branch
    will contain how we typically build calc and test calc (FYI: we
    normally enable things such as -Werror -Wextra -pedantic).  When we
    push out a release, Makefile.local will be stripped of non-comment
    lines.  Thus, releases of calc, and, released "calc*.src.rpm"
    files and the source tarballs, will have a Makefile.local with
    only comments.

    The "README.*" files and "HOWTO.INSTALL" file have been updated.

    By default, compiler warnings have been turned up.  The Makefile
    variable ${CCWARN} now defaults to:

	CCWARN= -Wall -Wextra -pedantic

    The previous level of compiler warnings can be easily restored by
    adding to Makefile.local:

	CCWARN:= -Wall

    The readline, history and ncurses libraries are now default.
    The Makefile variables ${USE_READLINE}, ${READLINE_LIB}, and
    ${READLINE_EXTRAS} now default to:

	USE_READLINE= -DUSE_READLINE
	READLINE_LIB= -lreadline
	READLINE_EXTRAS= -lhistory -lncurses

    The previous mode where readline, history and ncurses libraries
    were not compiled in by default can be easily restored by
    adding to Makefile.local:

	USE_READLINE:=
	READLINE_LIB:=
	READLINE_EXTRAS:=

    We have renamed "stable" as "production".
    We have renamed "unstable" as "tested".

    On the web site:

	http://www.isthe.com/chongo/src/calc/

    these files has been renamed:

	2.x.y.z_IS_LATEST_STABLE   ==> 2.x.y.z_IS_LATEST_PRODUCTION
	2.x.y.z_IS_LATEST_UNSTABLE ==> 2.x.y.z_IS_LATEST_TESTED

    The terms 'stable' and 'unstable' were both misleading and
    inaccurate.  For details see the new documention file:

	README.RELEASE

    See also the help command:

	; help release

    Fixed bug impacting how have_ustat.h was formed.

    Updated help/archive, BUGS, HOWTO.INSTALL to reflect GitHub use.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.14.0.11 to 2.14.0.12:

    Fixed a number of typos.

    Drop support for SunOS, IRIX and MINGW32_NT-5.0 targets.
    Drop support for CLOCK_SGI_CYCLE.  Drop testing for __MSDOS__.

    Minor improvement of various help files.  Made format of help
    files more consistent.

    Corrected a few comments in zrandom.c, including a case where
    the comment referred to 1007 when it should have used 2^32.

    Improved seed() generation.  Improved some comments in seed.c.
    Added have_environ.c to build have_environ.h in order to
    determine if:

	extern char **environ;	/* user environment */

    is an valid external symbol.

    Fixed documentation that referred to the old additive 55
    generator.  We have been using the subtractive 100 in place
    of the additive 55 generator for a while now.

    Fixed depend rule for custom/Makefile.

    Fixed how Makefile variable SHELL is set on macOS vs. Linux.
    Using /bin/sh on macOS due to how zsh treats globs by default.

    Added charbit.h to define CALC_CHARBIT which is either CHAR_BIT
    from <limits.h> or 8 or a value set by the Makefile variable
    CALC_CHARBIT.  Added have_limits.h to determine if <limits.h>
    is a system include file.

    Compiling now tests for _WIN64 as well when testing for _WIN32.

    Now assuming that <stdio.h> is available under _WIN32 and _WIN64.

    Added some preliminary notes about attempts to compile calc
    under Windows 11.

	BTW: While we are unable to use Windows 11, we welcome
	     Windows 11 developers to try compiling calc natively
	     (instead of via a Linux virtual machine).  If you are
	     able to compile Windows 11 natively, we would welcome
	     GitHub pull requests showing any needed modifications:

		https://github.com/lcn2/calc/pulls

	     Please also add notes to the 'Compiling calc under Windows 11'
	     section in README.WINDOWS file.

    We added Makefile.simple as part of the master branch source
    to help those who may be using a make tool that does not support
    GNU Make-like features such as "ifeq" and ":=".

    Fixed incorrect ustat_dev member ref in seed() builtin that
    was part of the unreleased calc v2.12.0.11.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.14.0.9 to 2.14.0.10:

    Due to issues with clang and Apple Silicon, ARCH_CFLAGS is now,
    by default, empty:

	ARCH_CFLAGS=

    If you want to use, say, -march=native, then either change
    the Makefile or make with:

	make all ARCH_CFLAGS='-march=native'

    Added arch and hardware as GNU Makefile computed values.
    As with ${target}, ${arch} and ${hardware} is computed by uname:

	target: uname -a
	arch: uname -p
	hardware: uname -m

    Fixed compiling calc on Apple Silicon with HomeBrew.  On Apple
    Silicon, HomeBrew installs on into a different location.  The
    Makefile checks if ${hardware} is arm64 and adjusts the location
    of libraries such as readline and history accordingly.

    Plugged a number of memory leaks.

    Fixed a few cases where v_subtype was not properly initialized.

    Improved the way that internal pre-defined constants are managed.
    Removed unused internal pre-defined constants.  Added code to
    prevent an internal pre-defined constant (that was never allocated)
    from being freed.

    Remove unnecessary spaces in-between or next to tabs.

    Update Copyright dates to account for 2021 modifications.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.14.0.7 to 2.14.0.8:

    Fizzbin is a better word. :-)

    The help and man builtin commands now return an error when a
    help file cannot be opened, such as when there is no help file.

    Added palindrome.cal resource file.  For example, to find the
    largest (highly probable) prime palindrome under 280 decimal
    digits (text tweet limit):

	prevprimepal(1e280)


The following are the changes from calc version 2.14.0.0 to 2.14.0.6:

    The :-separated default CALCRC value has been reversed.
    The default CALCRC was:

	${CALC_SHAREDIR}/startup:~/.calcrc:./.calcinit

    The default CALCRC is now:

	./.calcinit:~/.calcrc:${CALC_SHAREDIR}/startup

    See "help environment" for details.

    Added engineering mode as per a GitHub pull request from
    <GitHub user heitzmann>.  Thank you!  For example:

	; config("mode","eng"),
	; 10^41
		100e39

    or for example:

	; base(1000),
	; 2^23209-1
		~402.87411577898877818187e6984

    For more information see:

	help base

    Added regression test code for engineering mode.  Improved and
    expanded regression test code related to the base() and base2()
    builtin functions.

    Fixed a critical bug in the above mentioned pull request where
    a call to base2(1000) would make calc unstable and likely to
    dump core.

    Added builtin functions to convert between degrees, radians
    and gradians:

	d2r(deg)	- given degrees returns radians
	g2r(grad)	- given gradians returns radians

	r2d(rad)	- given radians returns degrees
	g2d(grad)	- given gradians returns degrees

	r2g(rad)	- given radians returns gradians
	d2g(deg)	- given degrees returns gradians

    Add 6 functions take a 2nd optional epsilon argument.
    For d2r(deg, ep), r2d(rad, ep), the optional 2nd epsilon argument controls
    the precision of the internal constant pi/180.
    For g2r(grad, ep), r2g(rad, ep), the optional 2nd epsilon argument controls
    the precision of the internal constant pi/200.
    The optional 2nd argument is ignored by g2d(grad, ep) and d2g(deg, ep).

    The clean and clobber makefile rules no longer list custom/Makefile
    as a dependency.

    Unfortunately due to the complex dependency issues between
    Makefile, Makefile.ship and custom/Makefile, parallel GNU make
    is NOT recommended.  Sorry (tm Canada) :)

    Fixed a few typos in CHANGES.

    As a side note: We stayed v2.13.x was kept for only a short time.
    The move to 2.14.x was motivated by non-compatible changes due to
    the default order of CALCRC, plus some new builtin functions.

    More changes are likely, so we might see another v2.14.0.x release
    before things are declared "recommended stable".

    Not that we want to discourage people from trying v2.14.0, you should
    try it.  We just want things to become stable and well field tested
    before we reach the "recommended stable" release state.

    Added builtin functions to convert between degrees and
    degrees, minutes and seconds under the config("mod")
    round rules:

	d2dms(degs, d, m, s [,rnd]) - given degs, compute d, m, s
	d2dm(degs, d, m [,rnd]) - given degs, compute d, m

	See help/d2dms and help/d2dm.

    Example:

	; print d2dms(360.321,deg=,min=,sec=), deg, min, sec;
	0.321 0 19 15.6

	; print d2dm(360.321,deg=,min=), deg, min;
	0.321 0 19.26

    Added builtin functions to convert between gradians and
    gradians, minutes and seconds under the config("mod")
    round rules:

	g2gms(grads, g, m, s [,rnd]) - given grads, compute g, m, s
	g2gm(grads, g, m [,rnd]) - given grads, compute g, m

	See help/g2gms and help/g2gm.

    Example:

	; print g2gms(400.321,grad=,min=,sec=), grad, min, sec;
	0.321 0 19 15.6

	; print g2gm(400.321,grad=,min=), grad, min;
	0.321 0 19.26

    Added builtin functions to convert between hours and
    hours, minutes and seconds under the config("mod")
    round rules:

	h2hms(hours, h, m, s [,rnd]) - given hours, compute h, m, s
	h2hm(hours, h, m [,rnd]) - given hours, compute h, m

	See help/h2hms and help/h2hm.

    Example:

	; print h2hms(24.321,hour=,min=,sec=), hour, min, sec;
	0.321 0 19 15.6

	; print h2hm(24.321,hour=,min=), hour, min;
	0.321 0 19.26

    Renumbered regression tests 3408 thru 3437, to 9102 thru 9131.

    Updated Added hms.cal resource file to use h2hms() builtin.
    Updated Added dms.cal resource file to use d2dms() builtin.

    Fix minor typo in help/mod SYNOPSIS.
    Fix minor typo in help/quo SYNOPSIS.

    Added a few more examples to help/strcmp.

    Added builtin functions to convert between degrees, minutes and
    seconds and degrees under the config("mod") round rules:

	dms2d(d, m, s [,rnd]) - convert deg, min, and secs to deg
	dm2d(d, m [,rnd]) - convert deg, min to deg

	See help/dms2d and help/dm2d.

    Example:

	; print dms2d(12, 20, 44.16);
	12.3456

	; print dm2d(3601, -25.5594);
	0.57401

    Added builtin functions to convert between gradians, minutes and
    seconds and gradians under the config("mod") round rules:

	gms2g(g, m, s [,rnd]) - convert grad, min, and secs to grad
	gm2g(g, m [,rnd]) - convert grad and min to grad

	See help/g2gms and help/g2gm.

    Example:

	; print gms2g(12, 20, 44.16);
	12.3456

	; print gm2g(4001, -25.5594);
	0.57401

    Added builtin functions to convert between hours, minutes and
    seconds and hours under the config("mod") round rules:

	hms2h(h, m, s [,rnd]) - convert hours, min, and secs to hours
	hm2h(h, m [,rnd]) - convert hours, min to hours

	See help/hms2h and help/hm2h.

    Example:

	; print hms2h(12, 20, 44.16);
	12.3456

	; print hm2h(241, -25.5594);
	0.57401

    Fixed typo in cal/statistics.cal thanks to a report by <GitHub user
    dennisaldea>.

    Fixed an old Windows pun in README.WINDOWS as requested by <GitHub
    user marcodegio>.

    Fixed a really obscure bug in the internal initconstants()
    function of const.c that has been sitting for over 31 years!

	We are amazed that nobody has encountered this bug before
	now.  Nevertheless, our very extensive regression and
	multi-architecture testing found the bug.  Now, after all
	those years, it is fixed.

    Fixed issues identified by the default CodeUL GitHub security code scan:

	Wrong type of arguments to printf in have_fpos_pos.c
	Multiplication result converted to larger type in zfunc.c


The following are the changes from calc version 2.13.0.1 to 2.13.0.1:

    Replaced /usr/local with the use of ${PREFIX} in calc Makefiles.

    The ${PREFIX} is not the same as ${T}.  The ${T} specifies
    a top level directory under which calc installs things.
    While usually ${T} is empty, it can be specific path
    as if calc where "chrooted" during an install.
    The ${PREFIX} value, during install, is a path between
    the top level ${T} install directory and the object
    such as an include file.

    Corrected a few more typos in Makefile comments.

    Added Makefile.local, a file with a single comment.  The main
    Makefile includes Makefile.local just before the first all rule.
    One may override any Makefile setting by modifying Makefile.local.
    For example, Makefile.local could force BLD_TYPE:

	HAVE_STRING_H:= YES
	HAVE_TIMES_H:= YES
	SED:= /usr/local/bin/nsed

    Added ${LOC_MKF} to specify the make of the file that is
    included just before the all file.  So one could place
    the above override lines into a different file and call
    make changing the ${LOC_MKF} value.  For example:

	make LOC_MKF=Makefile.private clobber all chk

    Updated HOWTO.INSTALL to mention Makefile.local.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.13.0.0 to 2.13.0.0:

    Fixed typo (missing quotes) in the env rule.

    Fixed indentation problem in CHANGES.

    Combined 2.12.9.1 changes into the 2.12.8.2 to 2.12.9.0
    range, and thus renamed the range to 2.12.8.2 to 2.12.9.1.

    Fixed issues related to building Makefile.simple.

    Fixed how the Makefile variable MANPATH is set for macOS.

    Added a bunch of information to the near bottom of HOWTO.INSTALL
    on calc Makefiles.  This information discusses the various
    Makefiles found in the calc source.

    Added comments in various calc Makefiles about their origin.
    In particular, for Makefiles that are constructed such as
    Makefile.simple, custom/Makefile and custom/Makefile.simple
    there are comments about how they were made.

    For all calc Makefiles, including those in sub-directories,
    near the top there is now a line of the form:

	# SRC: ... some message about the origin ...

    Fixed how the calc(1) man page is installed under macOS.

    Fixed how calc man page in ${CATDIR} is formed.

    Fixed how Makefile.simple is formed.

    Fixed the #! calc script argument processing.  The initial #!
    line must end in a -f.  For example, if calc is in /usr/local/bin/calc,
    then the following would be the first line of a calc script:

	#!/usr/local/bin/calc -f
	...

    It is common that -q be used with a calc script, so assuming the
    same /usr/local/bin/calc path:

	#!/usr/local/bin/calc -q -f
	...

    Use of -s in the #! first line of a calc script is not needed
    since -f implies -f.

    The argv() will now return values more typical of C's main().
    Before it returned one less than the number of arguments.  Now,
    for example, when calc is given 2 args, argv() will return 3.

    The value of argv(0) will be the path to calc, or in the
    case of a #! calc cscript, it will return the name of the script.

    Updated the calc man page and help/argv to reflect the
    above changes.

    Improved the formatting of the calc man page.

    Fixed the formation of the win32 sub-directory via the win32_hsrc
    Makefile rule.

    Due to incompatible changes to the argv() function, and #! calc
    scripts, we are setting the version to the next minor number:

	2.13.0.x

    Updated BUGS file as per v2.13.0 fixes.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.8.2 to 2.12.9.1:

    Added notes to help/unexpected about:

	display() will limit the number of digits printed after decimal point

	%d will format after the decimal point for non-integer numeric values

	%x will format as fractions for non-integer numeric values

	fprintf(fd, "%d\n", huge_value) may need fflush(fd) to finish

    Fixed Makefile dependencies for the args.h rule.

    Fixed Makefile cases where echo with -n is used.  On some systems,
    /bin/sh does not use -n, so we must call /bin/echo -n instead
    via the ${ECHON} Makefile variable.

    Add missing standard tools to sub-Makefiles to make them
    easier to invoke directly.

    Sort lists of standard tool Makefile variables and remove duplicates.

    Declare the SHELL at the top of Makefiles.

    Fixed the depend rule in the custom Makefile.

    Improved the messages produced by the depend in the Makefiles.

    Changed the UNUSED define in have_unused.h to be a macro with
    a parameter.  Changed all use of UNUSED in *.c to be UNUSED(x).

    Removed the need for HAVE_UNUSED in building the have_unused.h file.

    CCBAN is given to ${CC} in order to control if banned.h is in effect.

    The banned.h attempts to ban the use of certain dangerous functions
    that, if improperly used, could compromise the computational integrity
    if calculations.

    In the case of calc, we are motivated in part by the desire for calc
    to correctly calculate: even during extremely long calculations.

    If UNBAN is NOT defined, then calling certain functions
    will result in a call to a non-existent function (link error).

    While we do NOT encourage defining UNBAN, there may be
    a system / compiler environment where re-defining a
    function may lead to a fatal compiler complication.
    If that happens, consider compiling as:

	make clobber all chk CCBAN=-DUNBAN

    as see if this is a work-a-round.

    If YOU discover a need for the -DUNBAN work-a-round, PLEASE tell us!
    Please send us a bug report.  See the file:

	BUGS

    or the URL:

	http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/calc/calc-bugrept.html

    for how to send us such a bug report.

    Added the building of have_ban_pragma.h, which will determine
    if "#pragma GCC poison func_name" is supported.  If it is not,
    or of HAVE_PRAGMA_GCC_POSION=-DHAVE_NO_PRAGMA_GCC_POSION, then
    banned.h will have no effect.

    Fixed building of the have_getpgid.h file.
    Fixed building of the have_getprid.h file.
    Fixed building of the have_getsid.h file.
    Fixed building of the have_gettime.h file.
    Fixed building of the have_strdup.h file.
    Fixed building of the have_ustat.h file.
    Fixed building of the have_rusage.h file.

    Added HAVE_NO_STRLCPY to control if we want to test if
    the system has a strlcpy() function.  This in turn produces
    the have_strlcpy.h file wherein the symbol HAVE_STRLCPY will
    be defined, or not depending if the system comes with a
    strlcpy() function.

    If the system does not have a strlcpy() function, we
    compile our own strlcpy() function.  See strl.c for details.

     Added HAVE_NO_STRLCAT to control if we want to test if
     the system has a strlcat() function.  This in turn produces
     the have_strlcat.h file wherein the symbol HAVE_STRLCAT will
     be defined, or not depending if the system comes with a
     strlcat() function.

     If the system does not have a strlcat() function, we
     compile our own strlcat() function.  See strl.c for details.

     Fixed places were <string.h>, using #ifdef HAVE_STRING_H
     for legacy systems that do not have that include file.

     Added ${H} Makefile symbol to control the announcement
     of forming and having formed hsrc related files.  By default
     H=@ (announce hsrc file formation) vs. H=@: to silence hsrc
     related file formation.

     Explicitly turn off quiet mode (set Makefile variable ${Q} to
     be empty) when building rpms.

     Improved and fixed the hsrc build process.

     Forming rpms is performed in verbose mode to assist debugging
     to the rpm build process.

     Compile custom code, if needed, after main code is compiled.

    Fixed a typo typo in help/Makefile that caused the build of
    2.12.9.0 to fail in a number of cases.  Thanks to a report by
    <GitHub user balducci>.

    Pass form Makefile variables ${Q}, ${S}, ${E}, ${H} and ${V} down
    to all sub-directory Makefiles from the top level Makefile.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.8.1 to 2.12.8.2:

    Fixed how the *.tar.bz2 are formed.  The calc-2.12.8.0.tar.bz2 file
    that was formed for calc version 2.12.8.0 was missing most files.

    Expanded 'make chk' to also verify that 'make distchk' and 'make
    distlist' execute successfully.  This will help check a regression
    of the bug that produced the bogus calc-2.12.8.0.tar.bz2 file.

    Added additional regression tests related 0^(zero_expression)==1.

    Calc can now correctly compile without CUSTOM being defined,
    thanks to a report by <GitHub user barsnick>.



The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.7.5 to 2.12.8.0:

    Fixed a mistake in "help intro" where some inserted text changed
    the value of "." and thus made the next result incorrect.

    Clarified in "help factor" that 1 is returned if no
    factor below the limit was found.

    Removed Makefile variable ${MAKEFILE_REV}.

    The missing cscript/square.calc file has been restored.

    Fixed compiler errors and warnings related to GCC.  In particular,
    gcc/9.3.1 and gcc/10.2.1 now compile calc without any compiler
    errors or warnings, even with -Werror -Wextra -pedantic.

    To print out information about the calc compilation
    environment, we added the following make rule:

	make calcinfo

    Improved how 'make debug' operates.

    Moved help/contrib to CONTRIB-CODE.  The help/contrib file
    is now build from a copy of CONTRIB-CODE.

    Created a new calc bug report Email address.  Created a new
    calc question Email address.  Created a new calc contribution
    Email address.  See the BUGS file for details.

    Added "help questions" to print the QUESTIONS help file.

    If the environment variable $CALCHELP is defined and is non-empty,
    then calc help files will be in the directory by the $CALCHISTFILE
    environment variable.

    If the environment variable $CALCCUSTOMHELP is defined and is
    non-empty, then custom calc help files will be in the directory
    by the $CALCCUSTOMHELP environment variable.

    Fixed a number of typos in text and in source code comments.

    The calc-tester mailing list has been retired.  See:

The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.7.1 to 2.12.7.5:

    Corrected CHANGES notes that were mixed up for TAB, VT, CR &
    NL.  The code in 2.12.7.0 is correct.  The CHANGE notes should
    have read:

	The following is a partial list of escape sequences recognized
	in strings and in printf formats:

	    \a	audible bell	byte 0x07 in ASCII encoding
	    \b	backspace	byte 0x08 in ASCII encoding
	    \f	form feed	byte 0x0c in ASCII encoding
	    \n	newline		byte 0x0a in ASCII encoding
	    \r	return		byte 0x0d in ASCII encoding
	    \t	tab		byte 0x09 in ASCII encoding
	    \v	vertical tab	byte 0x0b in ASCII encoding

    Fixed a segfault when getpwuid() returned NULL during initialization.
    Thanks goes to baratharon GitHub user for reporting this issue.

    Requiring calc shell scripts to use -s -f at the end of the
    initial #! line.

    Fixed /tmp/mersenne example in calc(1) man page.

    Added make variable ${ARCH_CFLAGS}.  The ${ARCH_CFLAGS} is
    added after ${CCMISC} and before ${EXTRA_CFLAGS} when building
    the ${CFLAGS} for compiling C code.  are ${CC} when compiling
    C files.  The default value is:

	ARCH_CFLAGS= -march=native

    which directs C compiler to compile for the native machine.
    To disable use of '-march=native', set ARCH_CFLAGS to the empty
    string as in:

	make all ARCH_CFLAGS=

    To make calc RPMs more portable, they are compiled with an
    empty ARCH_CFLAGS.

    Fixed issues relating to compiling on macOS.  Fixed issues
    where <unistd.h> is needed.

    Fixed typos in help/intro and README.md. <<GitHub guilhermgonzaga>>

    Copied missing description lines from help/intro to README.md
    "What is calc?" section.  <<GitHub guilhermgonzaga>>

    GCC 7 added a warning on fall through in case statements.  It's
    enabled by -Wextra and treated as an error due to -Wall so it
    breaks compilation.  See -Wimplicit-fallthrough in the GCC
    manual.  The default value is 3, which means a comment matching
    some specific regexes is enough to disable the warning.
    Fixed spaces vs tabs and use FALLTHRU as it's used elsewhere.
    Fixed one FALLTHRU comment that was inconsistent with others.
    <<GitHub jcul>>

    Fixed minor typo on help/power. <<GitHub thegithubr>>

    By default, the calc history file is located in ~/.calc_history.
    Now, if the environment variable $CALCHISTFILE is defined
    and is non-empty, then calc history file will be defined
    by the $CALCHISTFILE environment variable.

    Calc as defined 0^0 as 1.  However in the past, 0 raised to
    an expression that evaluated to zero returned 1.  The result
    was that 0^0 was different than 0^(6-6) or even 0^(0).
    Now, calc will return 1 for 0^(0) and 0^zero when zero == 0.

    The missing cscript/square.calc file has been restored.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.6.10: to 2.12.7.0:

    Added a patch to replaces the manual search for include files
    in $(INCDIR) in the have_*.h targets with compiler invocations.
    Thanks goes to Helmut Grohne (helmut at subdivi dot de) who
    implemented the patch and posted it to the Debian bug tracker
    and Martin Buck (m at rtin-buck dor de) for forwarding it to us.

    The check_include make rule was fixed to not assume /usr/include.

    The qprintnum() function now takes outdigits as a 3rd argument.
    Most of the time, this 3rd argument is just conf->outdigits.
    But when it comes to the experimental '%g', this value can
    change.  This avoids having to modify conf->outdigits.

    Fixed a problem where gcc complains about E_FUNC not being defined
    for Linux systems as reported by Martin Buck (m at rtin-buck dor de).

    Updated the help files help/config, help/display, help/epsilon,
    help/fprint, help/printf, and help/strprintf to give more
    examples of how display digits and epsilon precision interact
    with displaying values.

    Added more information about %g in the help file help/printf.

    The '\a' is now recognized in a printf format string as the
    single byte audible bell character (byte 0x07 in ASCII encoding).

    The following is a partial list of escape sequences recognized
    in strings and in printf formats:

	\a	audible bell	byte 0x07 in ASCII encoding
	\b	backspace	byte 0x08 in ASCII encoding
	\f	form feed	byte 0x0c in ASCII encoding
	\n	newline		byte 0x0a in ASCII encoding
	\r	return		byte 0x0d in ASCII encoding
	\t	tab		byte 0x09 in ASCII encoding
	\v	vertical tab	byte 0x0b in ASCII encoding


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.6.9 to 2.12.6.9:

    Fixed a number of core dump bugs related to the calculation of
    tan(), cot(), sec(), csc(), tanh(), coth(), sech(), and csch(),
    asin(), acos(), asinh(), acosh(), where when a call to an
    underlying function produced an invalid value.  Thanks goes to
    github user wuxiuheng for reporting this problem.

    A number of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions that incorrectly
    returned E_LOGINF, now return a new error code that is more
    specific to the trigonometric or hyperbolic function.  The
    following is a list of these new error codes: E_TAN3 E_TAN4
    E_COT3 E_COT4 E_SEC3 E_CSC3 E_TANH3 E_TANH4 E_COTH3 E_COTH4
    E_SECH3 E_CSCH3 E_ASIN3 E_ACOS3 E_ASINH3 E_ACOSH3 E_ATAN3 E_ACOT3
    E_ASEC3 E_ACSC3 E_ATANH3 E_ACOTH3 E_ASECH3 E_ACSCH3.

    Added regression tests 3729 thru 3732 to test E_TAN3, E_COT3,
    E_SEC3 and E_CSC3 respectively.

    Added experimental %g printf (and strprintf) format implementation
    based on pull request from github user 10110111.

    Made experimental changes to macOS builds to not require use of
    /usr/include.  The INCDIR for macOS uses:

	INCDIR= $(shell xcrun --show-sdk-path --sdk macosx)/usr/include

    to determine the upper path of the /usr/include directory for macOS.
    In some rare cases, the Darwin target seems to not automatically detected.
    If you are running under macOS, and that happens, you can force
    the target to be Darwin:

	# for macOS users only, force the target to be darwin
	#
	make target=Darwin clobber
	make target=Darwin all
	make target=Darwin chk
	make target=Darwin install


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.6.6 to 2.12.6.8:

    For historical purposes, in lucas.cal, gen_v1(1, n) always returns 4.

    Fixed some compiler warnings, thanks to a report by Mike
    <michael dot d dot ince at gmail dot com>.

    Added work around for a gcc warning bug, thanks to a report by Mike
    <michael dot d dot ince at gmail dot com>.

    Fixed errors in various help files such as:

	mat randbit seed srandom types

    Removed the MAXSTRING symbol because it was no longer used by calc.

    Increased HIST_SIZE (depth of the history stack) from 10k to 32k.

    Increased TTYSIZE (reallocation size for terminal buffers) from 100 to 8191.

    Increased MAXDEPTH (maximum depth of input stack) from 10 to 255.

    Increased interactive input buffer size from 1024 to 256k.  This has the
    effect of increasing the maximum length of an input line from a tty.
    This helps with an interactive bug that was reported by Ruslan Kabatsayev
    (b7 dot 10110111 at gmail dot com).

    The calc man page indicates that -d also disables the printing of the
    leading tilde.

    Added information to "help command" about how to silence messages
    while reading calc resource files.

    Fixed an error message buffer overflow thanks to a report by
    Frank Peters <nlp at northernlightsphoto dot biz>.

    Replaced all use of the C function sprintf() with snprintf().
    Replaced all use of the C funcion vsprintf() with vsnprintf().
    Replaced all DONT_HAVE_VSPRINTF with DONT_HAVE_VSNPRINTF.
    Replaced all Makefile var ${HAVE_VSPRINTF} with ${HAVE_VSNPRINTF}.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.6.4 to 2.12.6.5:

    Fixed warning about undefined operations involving the qlink(q)
    macro by replacing that macro with an inline-function.  Thanks goes
    to David Haller <dnh at opensuse dot org> for this fix.

    NOTE for Windows 10 users: Pavel Nemec <pane at seznam dot cz>
    reported that calc version 2.12.6.4 has been successfully
    compiled, installed and running on Windows 10.  See README.WINDOWS
    for more details.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.6.1 to 2.12.6.3:

    Improved gen_v1(h,n) in lucas.cal to use an even faster search method.

    Improved are checking in lucas.cal.  In particular both h and n must be
    integers >= 1.  In the case of both rodseth_xhn(x, h, n) and gen_v1(h, n)
    h must be odd.

    Fixed an C code indenting issue that was reported by Thomas Walter
    <th dot walter42 at gmx dot de> in zfunc.c.

    Fixed a man page warning about ./myfile where the leading dot
    was mistook for an nroff macro.  Thanks goes to David Haller
    <dnh at opensuse dot org> for providing the patch.

    Improved gen_v1(h,n) in lucas.cal for cases where h is not a
    multiple of 3. Optimized the search for v(1) when h is a
    multiple of 3.

    Fixed a Makefile problem, reported by Doug Hays <doughays6 at gmail
    dot com>, where if a macOS user set BINDIR, LIBDIR, CALC_SHAREDIR
    or INCDIR in the top section, their values will be overwritten by
    the Darwin specific section.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.6.0 to 2.12.6.0:

    Added the makefile variable ${COMMON_ADD} that will add flags
    to all compile and link commands. The ${COMMON_ADD} flags are
    appended to both ${COMMON_CFLAGS} and ${COMMON_LDFLAGS}.  This
    facility is available to nearly all platforms except those with
    very old make commands that do not understand the += operator.

    Example on macOS (Darwin), one may invoke clang's -fsanitize
    facility by:

	make clobber all \
	  COMMON_ADD='-fsanitize=undefined -fsanitize=address'

    Another example.  To force C warnings to be treated as errors:

	make COMMON_ADD='-Werror'

    Created a GitHub repository for calc:

	https://github.com/lcn2/calc

    NOTE: The calc GitHub repository represents the an active
	  development stream.  While an effort will be made to keep
	  the master branch of the calc GitHub repository in working
	  order, that tree may be unstable.  Those wishing for more
	  reliable releases use releases found at calc mirror sites:

	    http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/calc/calc-mirror.html

    IMPORTANT NOTE:

	On 2017 June 05, the calc GitHub history was re-written.
	Anyone who was tracking the calc "pre-release" on GitHub prior
	to version 2.12.6.0 should do a:

	    git reset --hard origin/master
	    git cleanup -f

	Or you may just want to start over:

	    rm -rf calc
	    git clone https://github.com/lcn2/calc.git

	Sorry about that.  The previous GitHub repository was an useful
	experiment.  Based on what we learned, we decided to rebuild it.

    Renamed README to README.FIRST.  Added README.md for the
    GitHub repository.

    Fixed reading from standard input (stdin) when -p is given on
    the command line.  This now prints hello:

	echo hello | calc -p 'stdin = files(0); print fgetline(stdin);'

    Added more debugging related to stdin when bit 4 of calc_debug
    is set (e.g., running calc with -D16).

    Updated the calc(1) man page and 'help file' to explain about
    reading from standard input (stdin).

    Added some clarifying remarks for 'help ptest' explaining that
    the ptest builtin can return 1 is some cases where the test
    value is a pseudoprime.

    Removed duplicate copyright comments from the help/builtin that
    is built.

    Fixed a number of typos in the CHANGES file.

The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.5.4 to 2.12.5.6:

    Recompile to match current RHEL7.2 libc and friends.

    Added fix by Alexandre Fedotov <fedotov at mail dot desy dot de>
    to prepend ${T} in front of the CALCPATH path components
    ${CALC_SHAREDIR} and ${CUSTOMDIR}.  Add ${T} in front of ${HELPDIR}
    and ${CUSTONHELPDIR} when making conf.h.

    Improved the jacobi help page.

    Rewrote gen_v1() in the lucas.cal resource file using the method
    based on a paper:

	"A note on primality tests for N = h*2^n-1", by Oystein J. Rodseth,
	Department of Mathematics, University of Bergen, BIT Numerical
	Mathematics. 34 (3): pp 451-454.

	http://folk.uib.no/nmaoy/papers/luc.pdf

    The improved gen_v1() function is capable of returning a value
    for all valid values of h and n.  As a result, the trial tables
    used by gen_v1() have been changed to a short list of values
    to try, in order ot likelihood of success, before doing an
    exhaustive search for a v1 value to return.

    Removed lucas_tbl.cal calc resource file.  This file was made
    obsolete by the above rewrite of the lucas.cal resource file.
    This file will be removed from the local cal directory and
    from CALC_SHAREDIR during a 'make install', 'make clobber',
    and 'make uninstall'.

    Renamed gen_u0() to gen_u2() in lucas.cal.  Provided a gen_u0()
    stub function that calls gen_u2() for backward compatibility.

    The old gen_v1() method used by the Amdahl 6 group has been
    renamed legacy_gen_v1() in lucas.cal.  This function is no
    longer used by the lucas(h, n) function to test the primality of
    h*2^n-1.  It is preserved in lucas.cal for historical purposes.

    The 'make clobber' rule will attempt to remove all files that
    start with libcalc and start with libcustcalc.

    The 'man' command is now an alias for the 'help' command.

    Fixed extra /'s that were put into CALCPATH because of ${T}.
    Fixed extra /'s that were compiled into HELPDIR and CUSTOMHELPDIR.

    The fix in 2.12.5.4 to to prepend ${T} in front of the CALCPATH
    path components ${CALC_SHAREDIR} and ${CUSTOMDIR} broke the
    calc rpm build process.  The check-buildroot tool discovered
    that the BUILDROOT directory had been improperly put into various
    paths and binaries.  This has been fixed in 2.12.5.5.

    Fixed a crash that showed up on macOS (Darwin) that was reported
    by Richard Outerbridge <outer at interlog dot com> and
    fixed by Stuart Henderson <stu at spacehopper dot org>.
    Thanks goes to both!


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.5.3 to 2.12.5.3:

    Calc version 2.12.5.2 for macOS (Darwin) users, code to installed
    calc under /opt/calc.  Moreover the CHANGES file did not mention
    /opt/calc.  Sorry about that!.

    A much better tree for macOS (Darwin) users would have been
    to install cal under /opt/calc.  This release ONLY changes the
    macOS (Darwin) install tree to /usr/local.

    macOS (Darwin) users who installed calc version 2.12.5.2
    should, after installing version 2.12.5.3:

	rm -rf /opt/calc


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.5.1 to 2.12.5.2:

    NOTE: calc version 2.12.5.2, for macOS (Darwin) users,
	  installed under /opt/calc.  We neglected to mention this
	  AND /usr/local would have been a better choice.  Sorry!
	  Fixed in calc version 2.12.5.3.

    Removed rules and makefile variables associated with shortened
    calc version numbers of less than 4 levels.

    Under OS X (Darwin), if /usr/include is missing, warnings
    are issued to help the user use xcode-select --install
    so that one may properly compile C code.

    Lowered REDC levels:

	#define MAXREDC 256	/* number of entries in REDC cache */

	#define SQ_ALG2 28	/* size for alternative squaring */
	    config("sq2") == 28		/* was 3388 */
	#define MUL_ALG2 28	/* size for alternative multiply */
	    config("mul2") == 28	/* was 1780 */
	#define POW_ALG2 20	/* size for using REDC for powers */
	    config("pow2") == 20	/* was 176 */
	#define REDC_ALG2 25	/* size for using alternative REDC */
	    config("redc2") == 25	/* was 220 */

    The alg_config.cal script appears to be not correctly finding the
    best REDC values.  While it has been improved, alg_config.cal still
    seems to be suspect on how it attempts to find the best values.

    Fixed an intro help file mistake found by Roger Hardiman
    <roger at rjh dot org dot uk>.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.5.0 to 2.12.5.1:

    There is a new calc bug report Email address:

	    calc-bug-report at asthe dot com

	This replaces the old calc-bugs at asthe dot com address.

	To be sure we see your Email reporting a calc bug, please use the
	following phase in your Email Subject line:

	    calc bug report

	That phrase in your subject line will help ensure your
	request will get past our anti-spam filters.  You may have
	additional words in your subject line.

	However, you may find it more helpful to simply subscribe
	to the calc-tester mailing list (see above) and then to
	send your report to that mailing list as a wider set calc
	testers may be able to help you.

    The following makefile rules that were related to printing the
    upper values of the calc version, rules that were made obsolete
    in calc version 2.12.4.14, have been removed:

	calc_vers calc_ver calc_ve
	vers ver ve

    Noted that the hash() builtin function, internally known as
    quickhash (used for internal objects such as the associative
    arrays as well as other internal processes) uses the deprecated
    32-bit FNV-0 hash.  The use of this deprecated hash is sufficient
    for calc internal purposes.  Use of FNV-1a is recommended for
    a general non-cryptographic quick hash.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.4.14 to 2.12.5.0:

    For Apple OS X / Darwin target:

	MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is no longer defined
	using clang compiler

	By default, -install-name is used when forming shared libs.
	To force -install-name to not be used, set SET_INSTALL_NAME=no.

    The have_stdvs.c test uses <stdlib.h> and fixed va_start() test call
    that didn't use last arg.

    Fixed math_fmt (printf) in value.c where a LEN (SB32) be printed as %d.

    Fixed a significant bug where that resulted in an incorrect
    complex number comparison.  Thanks goes to David Binderman
    <dcb314 at hotmail dot com> for identifying the subtle typo!

    Make minor fixes to the make depend rule.

    Fixed places were calc defined a reserved identifier that
    begin with either __ or _[A-Z].  For example, __FILE_H__ has
    been replaced with INCLUDE_FILE_H.

    Fixed the addall3 example in the script help file.  Thanks for this
    fix goes to Igor Furlan <igor dot furlan at gmail dot com>.

    We made important fixes to the calc command line history:

	Fixed a bug in the command line history where calc would sometimes
	crash.  There was code that used memcpy() instead of memmove()
	that could corrupt the command line history when entering a
	into into history that was similar to a previous entry.  Thanks
	goes to Einar Lielmanis <einars at spicausis dot lv> for first
	identifying this mistake.

	The calc command line history code, in general was not robust.
	We made use a patch from Mathias Buhr <napcode at users dot sf
	dot net>, that while it uses a bit more memory: is much more
	flexible, readable and robust.  This patch replaced the improper
	use of memcpy() (see above) with better code.  Thanks!

    The alg_config.cal calc resource file has been reworked to produce
    better diagnostics while attempting to determine the ideal values
    for mul2, sq2, and pow2.  However, it has been shown that this
    code is not correct.  Suggestions for a replacement are welcome!

	calc -u 'read alg_config; config("user_debug", 2),; best_mul2();'
	calc -u 'read alg_config; config("user_debug", 2),; best_sq2();'
	calc -u 'read alg_config; config("user_debug", 2),; best_pow2();'

    Fixed a number of pedantic compiler warnings.

    Removed -W and -Wno-comment from the the CCWARN makefile variable.

    Removed no_implicit.arg makefile rule.  Removed HAVE_NO_IMPLICIT
    makefile variable.  Removed no_implicit.c source file.

    Added WNO_IMPLICT makefile variable to hold the compiler flag
    -Wno-implicit for use on selective compile lines.

    Added WNO_ERROR_LONG_LONG makefile variable to hold the compiler flag
    -Wno-error=long-long for use on selective compile lines.

    Added WNO_LONG_LONG makefile variable to hold the compiler flag
    -Wno-long-long for use on selective compile lines.

    The makefile variable ${MKDIR_ARG} has been replaced with just -p.

    Minor fixes were made to the calc.spec.in file.

    The target rpm architecture changed from i686 to x86_64.  For those
    who do not run machine with x86_64, we continue to release a src
    rpm. For those without the ability to process an rpm, we will always
    to release src tarball.

    When building the libcalc and libcustcalc shared  libraries,
    ONLY the .so and .so.${VERSION} files are created.  The .so is
    a symlink to the .so.${VERSION} file.  Here ${VERSION} is the
    full "w.x.y.z" calc version.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.4.11 to 2.12.4.13:

    Fixed many typos in comments of the Makefile thanks to the review
    work of Michael Somos.

    Fixed typo in "help sysinfo".

    The Makefile rule, debug, is now more verbose and prints more information
    about the calc compiled constants.

    Added a more of calc resource files by
    Christoph Zurnieden <czurnieden at gmx dot de> including:

    infinities.cal - handle infinities symbolically, a little helper file
    intnum.cal - implementation of tanh sinh and Gauss-Legendre quadrature
    smallfactors.cal - find the factors of a number < 2^32
    strings.cal - implementation of isascii() and isblank()

    Reformatted some calc resource files.  Cleanup in comment the headers
    of some calc resource files.

    Minor formatting changes to a few help files.

    No need to be special picky about the test8900.cal calc resource file.

    Added a number of ctype-like builtins:

    isalnum - whether character is alpha-numeric
    isalpha - whether character is alphabetic
    iscntrl - whether character is a control character
    isdigit - whether character is a digit character
    isgraph - whether character is a graphical character
    islower - whether character is lower case
    isprint - whether character is a printable
    ispunct - whether character is a punctuation
    isspace - whether character is a space character
    isupper - whether character is upper case
    isxdigit - whether character a hexadecimal digit
    strcasecmp - compare two strings, case independent
    strncasecmp - compare two strings up to n characters, case independent
    strtolower - transform an ASCII string to lower case
    strtoupper - transform an ASCII string to upper case

    For details on these new builtins, see their help messages.
    Thanks goes to Inge Zurnieden <inge dot zurnieden at gmx dot de> for
    these new builtins.

    Calc source code is now picky v2.3 clean using:

	picky -s -v file file2 ..

    With the exception of:

	help/errorcodes.sed
	cal/set8700.line

    Due to the long lines in those files, we use:

	picky -w -s -v help/errorcodes.sed cal/set8700.line

    For more information about the picky tool, see:

	http://cis.csuohio.edu/~somos/picky.html

    Removed functions from strings.cal that have been replaced by
    the new ctype-like builtin functions.

    Fixed cal/Makefile to include missing intnum.cal file.

    Added detail_help_list make target to cal/Makefile.

    The detaillist make target in help/Makefile is now
    called detail_help_list.

    Removed requirement of gen_u0(h, n, v1) in lucas.cal that h
    be odd.  While still lucas(h, n) converts even h into an odd h
    internally by incrementing n, gen_u0(h, n, v1) will output even
    when h is even.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.4.6 to version 2.12.4.10:

    Updated RPM build process to remove use of deprecated flags.

    Applied a number of fixes to calc.spec and rpm.mk file.
    See calc.spec.in for details.  Changed rpm release to 2.1.

    Set MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.8 as we upgraded all of
    our development Mac OS X to 10.8.

    Libraries are chmod-ed as 0644 to allow for building rpms
    without root.

    Silenced annoying warning about unused variable 'intp'
    while compiling endian.c under some circumstances.

    Fixed typo in re-declaration warnings.  Thanks to
    Christoph Zurnieden <czurnieden at gmx dot de> for this report.

    Added a number of calc resource files by
    Christoph Zurnieden <czurnieden at gmx dot de> including:

    bernpoly.cal - Computes the nth Bernoulli polynomial at z for any n,z
    brentsolve.cal - root-finder implemented with the Brent-Dekker trick
    factorial.cal - product of the positive integers
    factorial2.cal - variety of integer functions quasi-related to factorial
    lambertw.cal - Computes Lambert's W-function at "z" at branch "branch"
    lnseries.cal - Calculates a series of natural logarithms at 1,2,3,4...n
    specialfunctions.cal - Calculates the value of the beta function
    statistics.cal - a wide variety of statistical functions
    toomcook.cal - Multiply by way of the Toom-Cook algorithm
    zeta2.cal - Calculate the value of the Hurwitz Zeta function

    Fixed a makefile bug that prevented the those new calc resource
    files from being installed.

    Improved the formatting of the output from:

	help resource

    We replaced COPYING-LGPL with the version that is found at
    http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.txt because that version
    contains some whitespace formatting cleanup.  Otherwise the
    license is the same.

    We fixed a number of places where "the the" was used
    when just "the" should be used.

	NOTE: Fixes to grammar, spelling and minor formatting
	      problems are welcome.  Please send us your patches!

    With the exception of 3 source files, we became "picky" about
    line lengths and other issues reported by the picky tool:

	cal/test8900.cal
	cal/set8700.line
	help/errorcodes.sed

    The above 3 files now pass picky -w (OK except for line length).
    For more information about the picky tool, see:

	http://cis.csuohio.edu/~somos/picky.html


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.4.3 to 2.12.4.5:

    Added gvec.cal resource script.

    Added calc-symlink make rule to setup symlinks from standard locations
    into a tree specified by a non-empty ${T} makefile variable.  Added
    calc-unsymlink to remove any symlinks that may have been created by
    the calc-symlink rule.

    If is OK for the calc-symlink make rule to pre-remove a symlink.

    Fixed bug was uncovered in calc that caused script failures when calc
    is called within a while loop in BASH if the while loop is fed from
    stdin due to calc's redirection/inheritance of stdin and no option
    to change this behavior.  Thanks gores to David C. Rankin
    <drankinatty at gmail dot com> for the bug fix and to David Haller
    <dnh at opensuse dot org> for helping debug this problem.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.4.0 to 2.12.4.2:

    Fixed a documentation bug for the sgn() builtin.

    Added the 1<<8/2 evaluation example to "help unexpected".  That
    expression evaluates to 128, not 16 as some C programmers might expect.

    Fixed a bug in solve.cal where high was not returned in some situations.

    Fixed a bug reported by Paul & Karen Tomlinson (paulnkaz at pktomlinson
    dot fsnet dot co dot uk) where calling log multiple times with different
    values of epsilon resulted in an incorrect value.

    Removed cvd rule from Makefiles.

    The Makefile used in the source rpm (calc-*.src.rpm) no longer uses
    the -Werror compile flag.  This is to help those distributions with
    compilers that make produce (hopefully) compilation warnings.
    NOTE: For testing and calc build purposes will recommend and will
    continue to use the -Werror flag.

    Fixed a typo in the Makefile where the make variable ${SAMPLE_OBJ}
    was misspelled as ${SAMPLE_OBJS}.

    Added prep makefile rule to make is easier to compile calc without
    an optimizer.  By doing:

	make clobber prep

    one may build a calc binary that is easier to debug.

    Fixed a bug where an certain typos (e.g., calling an unknown
    function) would previously cause calc to exit.

    Updated the COPYING file to reflect the new filenames associated
    with the SHA1 hash function, and removed mention of files related
    to the SHA (SHA0, not SHA1) and the MD5 hash functions (which is
    no longer supported in calc).

    Fixed a bug where a calling vsnprintf() twice created problems.
    The thanks for this fix goes to Matthew Miller (mattdm at mattdm
    dot org) for this patch.

    Michael Penk (mpenk at wuska dot com) reported success in installs
    under Windows via Cygwin by making a change to the Cygwin target.
    These changes have been folded into the main calc Makefile.
    The old recommendation of using 'make win32_hsrc' is no longer
    required for Cygwin.  See the README.WINDOWS file for details.

    Added dms.cal and hms.cal resource files.  The dms.cal is a more
    functional version of deg.cal.  It is a superset except that increment
    and decrement is on the arc second level.  The hms.cal is for
    24-hour cycle instead of the 360 degree cycle of dms.cal.

    Changed deg.cal object name from dms to deg so that the more functional
    dms.cal can own the dms object name.

    Updated 'help obj' to reflect changes to 'show objfunctions' and
    resource file example list since 1999.

    Fixed problem where CALC_BYTE_ORDER referring to CALC_BIG_ENDIAN
    and CALC_LITTLE_ENDIAN instead of BIG_ENDIAN and LITTLE_ENDIAN.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.3.0 to 2.12.3.3:

    Fixed the Jacobi function where it returned 1 when it should have
    returned 0.  Thanks goes to Kevin Sopp (baraclese at googlemail dot com)
    for discovering the problem and suggesting the nature if the fix.

    Calc versions will always be of the form x.y.z.w even when the
    MINOR_PATCH (w) is 0.  Thus, 2.12.3.0 will be printed as 2.12.3.0
    instead of just 2.12.3.

    Added MINGW32_NT-5.0 compile target based on a patch from
    Brian L. Angus (angus at eng dot utah dot edu).

    Removed the use of rpm.release in the Makefile.

    Mac OS Darwin targets no longer attempt to use ldconfig.  Under the
    Darwin target, the LDCONFIG make variable is redefined to be
    an empty value.  Thanks goes to Ralf Trinler (art at infra dot de)
    for reporting this problem.

    The ${CALC_INCDIR}/custom is no longer being removed at install time
    if it is empty.  Now when ${ALLOW_CUSTOM} make variable is empty,
    an empty ${CALC_INCDIR}/custom may be left behind.

    Fixed a problem where a "make clobber" would remove custom/Makefile
    and fail to rebuilt it.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.2.3 to 2.12.2.4:

    Added OpenBSD target.

    Using the -r test instead of the -e test in Makefiles because some
    out of date shells still do not have the -e test.

    The Makefile now avoids the use of if ! command because some out of
    date shells to not support the ! construct.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.1.1 to 2.12.2.2:

    Added an explicit Solaris target.

    Fixed confusion in Makefile where some uses of ${EXT} were misnamed ${EXE}.

    Added a "make strip" rule, per suggestion from Igor Furlan <primorec
    at sbcglobal dot net>, to allow one to strip previously built binary
    executables and libraries.

    Under the Darwin / OS X target, ${DARWIN_ARCH} is left empty meaning
    that calc is compiled for the native CPU type instead of Universal
    Binary (Intel and PPC).

    By default, the calc binary that is built for the rpm forces
    ${LD_SHARE} to be empty.  An empty ${LD_SHARE} means that the calc
    from the rpm does not set rpath.  This in turn causes the default
    system path to be searched when looking for libcalc and libcustcalc.

    The Makefile shipped with calc still sets ${LD_SHARE} for host targets.
    By default, the dynamic shared library search path for all targets
    starts with the source directory.  Starting the search in the source
    directory is convenient for testing and debugging but is not appropriate
    for installation on a production system.  To get the same effect
    as the calc binary in the calc rpm, try:

	make clobber
	make calc-dynamic-only BLD_TYPE=calc-dynamic-only LD_SHARE=
	make install

    The libcalc and libcustcalc shared libraries are now tied to
    the 4 level calc version instead of just 3 levels.  For example,
    under Linux calc version 2.12.2.1 uses /usr/lib/libcalc.so.2.12.2.1
    instead of just the /usr/lib/libcalc.so.2.12.2 file.  This change
    was made so that calc produced by 'make clobber; make all install'
    is consistent with the calc rpm.

    Calc is now releasing the calc-debuginfo rpm for those RPM users who
    which to use non-stripped libraries and binaries for debugging
    purposes.  By default, the calc rpm installed stripped binaries
    and libraries.

    Added this high priority item to the calc help/todo list:

	It is overkill to have nearly everything wind up in libcalc.
	Form a libcalcmath and a libcalclang so that an application
	that just wants to link with the calc math libs can use them
	without dragging in all of the other calc language, I/O,
	and builtin functions.

    Fixed the wording for the -i flag in the calc man page.

    Added some notes to the help/unexpected file regarding calc
    and interactive shells.

    Fixed bug where a FILEPOS was copied FPOS_POS_BITS octets instead of
    FPOS_POS_LEN octets.

    Split out ${READLINE_EXTRAS} Makefile variables from ${READLINE_LIB}
    to better deal with Fedora rpm requirements.

    Bit 8 (0x80) of calc_debug is reserved for custom debugging.
    See help/config and custom/HOW_TO_ADD for details.

    When the Makefile variable ${ALLOW_CUSTOM} is not defined or empty,
    the libcustcalc library is not built or linked against, certain make
    rules skip going into the custom sub-directory, the install
    rule skips certain custom installation actions, and the common
    C flags (${COMMON_CFLAGS}) is given -UCUSTOM.  Other make rules such
    as "make clean" and "make clobber" still work as before.  Also
    the Makefile.simple assumes that the Makefile variable ${ALLOW_CUSTOM}
    is -DCUSTOM.

    Clarified that the calc builtin functions rand() and random()
    operate over a half closed interval.  The help/rand and help/random
    refer to  the top of the interval as "beyond" instead of "max".

    Releasing source tar balls using bzip2 instead of with gzip.  So
    what was calc-something.tar.gz is now calc-something.tar.bz2.
    To "uncompress" use:

	bunzip2 calc-something.tar.bz2

    On some systems, one may untar directly by:

	tar -jxvf calc-something.tar.bz2

   The Makefile variable ${BYTE_ORDER} was replaced by ${CALC_BYTE_ORDER}.

   Changed the way the Makefile can force the calc byte order.  If you set
   the Makefile variable ${CALC_BYTE_ORDER} to be -DCALC_BIG_ENDIAN then
   endian.h will force the CPP symbol CALC_BYTE_ORDER to be BIG_ENDIAN.
   If you set ${CALC_BYTE_ORDER} to be -DCALC_LITTLE_ENDIAN then endian.h
   will force the CPP symbol CALC_BYTE_ORDER to be LITTLE_ENDIAN.
   If the Makefile variable ${CALC_BYTE_ORDER} is empty, then the CPP
   symbol CALC_BYTE_ORDER will set to the CPP symbol BYTE_ORDER as
   defined by some system include file (if the Makefile can find such
   an include file), or the Makefile compiling endian.c and hopefully
   using that result to set CPP symbol CALC_BYTE_ORDER.  Regardless of
   how it happens, the CPP symbol CALC_BYTE_ORDER should end up set in
   endian_calc.h include file.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.1.10 to 2.12.2:

    Put back the missing -s flags on the cscripts:  mersenne, 4dsphere,
    fprodcut, plus, and powerterm.  Thanks goes to Bradley Reed
    <bradreed1 at gmail dot com> for discovering this problem.

    All static variables are now declared with the symbol STATIC.
    All extern variables are now declared with the symbol EXTERN.
    All static functions are now declared with the symbol S_FUNC.
    All extern functions are now declared with the symbol E_FUNC.
    The include file decl.h defines these 4 symbols by default
    to static, extern, static, and extern respectively.  Under
    Windows, DLL is also defined according to the _EXPORTING symbol
    and is prepended to the EXTERN and E_FUNC symbols.  The decl.h
    file has replaced the win32dll.h file.

    When WITH_TLS is defined, calc attempts to compile with Thread Local
    Storage.  As of version 2.12.1.12 this mode is extremely experimental.
    Calc may not compile when WITH_TLS defined.

    Fixed E_FUNC vs EXTERN issues discovered by Mirko Viviani
    <mirko at objectlab dot org>.

    Removed include of <malloc.h>.  The building of the include file
    "have_malloc.h" has been removed from the Makefile.  One some
    systems such as FreeBSD, the file /usr/include/malloc.h exists
    and contains an forced error saying that stdlib.h should be used
    instead.  The Makefile symbol HAVE_MALLOC has been removed.

    Moved the sample code in the sample sub-directory up into the
    main source level.  The sample/many_random.c source file is
    now sample_many.c.  The sample/test_random.c source file is now
    sample_rand.c.  The sample Makefile and the sub-directory is no more.

    Renamed the following source files:

	math_error.h		==>    lib_calc.h
	string.c		==>    str.c
	string.h		==>    str.h

    Renamed the following variables related to calc error processing:

	int calc_jmp		==>    int calc_use_matherr_jmpbuf
	jmp_buf calc_jmp_buf	==>    jmp_buf calc_matherr_jmpbuf

	int post_init		==>    int calc_use_scanerr_jmpbuf
	jmp_buf jmpbuf		==>    jmpbuf calc_scanerr_jmpbuf

	char *calc_error	==>    char calc_err_msg[MAXERROR+1]

    These values are now declared in the lib_calc.h include file.
    The value MAXERROR is now defined in lib_calc.h instead of calc.h.
    The calc_err_msg[] buffer is now used for math errors as well
    as scan and parse errors.

    Parse/scan errors will not be printed if calc_print_scanerr_msg
    is zero.  By default:

	int calc_print_scanerr_msg = 1;

    This variable is declared in the lib_calc.h include file.  Storage
    comes from libcalc.

    Parse/scan warnings will not be printed if calc_print_scanwarn_msg
    is zero.  By default:

	int calc_print_scanwarn_msg = 1;

    This variable is declared in the lib_calc.h include file.  Storage
    comes from libcalc.

    The last parse/scan error message is stored in the calc_err_msg[]
    buffer.  This happens even when calc_print_scanerr_msg is zero.

    The last parse/scan warning message is stored in the calc_warn_msg[]
    buffer.  After each parse/scan warning condition is detected,
    the value calc_warn_cnt is incremented.  This happens even when
    calc_print_scanwarn_msg is zero.

    The calc_warn_msg[] buffer and calc_warn_cnt variables are declared
    in the lib_calc.h include file.  Storage comes from libcalc.

    See the file, LIBRARY or use the calc command "help libcalc" for
    more information on calc error processing.  This file has been
    updated to reflect the changes noted above in this section.

    The make install rule removes std_arg.h, have_malloc.h, math_error.h,
    string.h, and win32dll.h from ${INCDIR} if they exist.  These calc
    include files are no longer supported.

    Do reduce the number of special case .o build rules, the
    ${ALLOW_CUSTOM} make flag is added to ${CFLAGS} by default.  This means
    that if ALLOW_CUSTOM= -DCUSTOM, then -DCUSTOM is given to the compile
    line of most .c files.

    Calc -v reports "w/custom functions" or "w/o custom functions" on
    the version string depending on if calc was compiled with the
    ALLOW_CUSTOM= -DCUSTOM or not.

    Replaced the concept of compiler sets in the Makefile with
    host target section in the Makefile.  Initial host targets are:

	Linux
	Darwin
	FreeBSD
	(default)	<<== Target does not match any previous target name
	Simple

	NOTE: If your target is not supported below and the default target
	      is not suitable for your needs, please send to the:

		calc-contrib at asthe dot com

	      Email address an "ifeq ($(target),YOUR_TARGET_NAME)"
	      ... "endif" set of lines from the Makefile so that
	      we can consider them for the next release.

    The custom/Makefile is now constructed from 3 parts: custom/Makefile.head,
    the host target section in Makefile, and the custom/Makefile.tail.

    The top level Makefile and the custom/Makefile require a GNU make
    (such as gmake) or an equivalently advanced make.  On many targets,
    the default make is sufficient.  On FreeBSD for example, one must
    use gmake instead of make.

    If your target system does not have GNU make (or equivalent), then
    you should try using the Makefile.simple and custom/Makefile.simple
    files:

	mv Makefile Makefile.gmake
	cp Makefile.simple Makefile
	mv custom/Makefile custom/Makefile.gmake
	cp custom/Makefile.simple custom/Makefile
	make all

    Added the ability to build calc with dynamic libraries, static
    libraries or both.  Many thanks goes to Matthew Miller (mattdm
    at mattdm dot org) and Mirko Viviani (mirko at objectlab dot
    org) for this help, encouragement, and testing of this major change!

    Added BLD_TYPE Makefile variable to control how calc is
    built.  The BLD_TYPE value may be one of:

	BLD_TYPE= calc-dynamic-only
	BLD_TYPE= calc-static-only

    Each host target establishes a default BLD_TYPE value.  Of course
    one can override the host target BLD_TYPE on the make command line:

	make clobber
	make calc-dynamic-only BLD_TYPE=calc-dynamic-only

	make clobber
	make calc-static-only BLD_TYPE=calc-static-only

	NOTE: It is a very good idea to first clobber (remove) any previously
	      built .o, libs and executables before switching the build
	      between static and dynamic.

    which have the same effect as make all with a given build phase set.

    For Linux and Darwin, the default BLD_TYPE is calc-dynamic-only.
    For the simple case, BLD_TYPE is calc-static-only.  For the
    default target (the target does not match any of the previous
    defined targets), BLD_TYPE is calc-static-only.

    Added ${CSFLAGS} make variable to hold the {$CC} flags for compiling
    without shared library.  By default, ${CFLAGS} is ${CSFLAGS} with
    ${CC_SHARE} added to it.

    Added ${CC_SHARE}, ${LIBCALC_SHLIB}, ${LIBCUSTCALC_SHLIB}, and
    ${LD_SHARE} to the remaining compiler sets.

    Fixed make depend and make uninstall rules.   Performed various
    makefile syntax cleanups.

    Removed ${PROGS} and ${STATIC_PROGS} Makefile variables due to
    the new BLD_TYPE system (see above).

    Added missing help for cp, calcpath, and stoponerror.

    Noted that calc fails the regression test (and will crash at
    various times) when compiled with gcc v4.1.0.  This problem was
    first reported under Fedora Core 5 by Christian Siebert.

    Set the LESSCHARSET to iso8859 so that less will not confuse or
    upset the col utility with Invalid or incomplete multi-byte or wide
    characters.

    Updated the Free Software Foundation postal address and updated
    the COPYING-LGPL from http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/lgpl.txt
    on 2007-Mar-14.  Calc is using the same Version 2.1 of the LGPL,
    only the postal address of the Free Software Foundation has
    been updated.  All source files were updated to RCS level 30.
    Thanks goes to Martin Buck (m at rtin-buck dor de) for this patch.

    Added printf arg checking for GNU C compilers that helps check
    printf-style functions in calc.  Thanks goes to Martin Buck (m at
    rtin-buck dor de) for this patch.

    Fixed issues where the argument of a printf-like did not match the
    format type.

    Removed build function md5().  The MD5 hash has been compromised to
    such a degree that is it no longer advisable to use this function.

    Removed build function sha().  The SHA hash has been compromised to
    such a degree that is it no longer advisable to use this function.
    Note that the SHA-1 hash has not been compromised to the same degree
    and so this hash function remains.

    Renamed shs1.c to sha1.c.  Renamed shs1.h to sha1.h.

    Added custom registers.  The custom register function:

	custom("register", 3)

    returns the value of custom register 3.  Custom registers, initialized
    with 0, may take on any calc value:

	custom("register", regnum, value)

    Added REGNUM_MAX to the sysinfo custom function to return the maximum
    register number:

	custom("sysinfo", "REGNUM_MAX")

    which defaults to 31.  The first custom register is 0 and thus the
    default number of custom registers is 32.

    Added E_OK #define in calc.h to indicate no error (0).

    Renamed C function powivalue() in value.c to powvalue() because it
    now handles raising NUMBER or COMPLEX to a NUMBER or COMPLEX power.

    The powervalue() function in value.c may be given a NULL epsilon
    which will cause to the builtin epsilon value to be used.

    Calc supports both real and complex exponentiation bases and exponents.
    For a ^ b and a ** b, "a" and "b" can be a real value or a complex value:

        2^3                     3i^4
	2.5 ^ 3.5               0.5i ^ 0.25
	2.5 ^ 2.718i            3.13145i ^ 0.30103i

    Fixed typos in the calc man page thanks to a Debian bug report
    by A. Costa <agcosta at gis dot .net> that was kindly forwarded
    to us by Martin Buck <m at rtin-buck dot de>.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.1.8 to 2.12.1.9:

    Fixed calc cscripts that contained comments that were not valid calc
    comments.  Improved calc comment documentation in "help unexpected"
    to help other avoid similar mistakes.  Calc comments are of the form:

	/* c style comments */
	/*
	 * multi-line
	 * comments
	 */
	## two or more #-signs
	### in a row
	### Note that # along is a calc unary and binary operator

    Added "help pound" or "help #' to document the # operator, comments,
    and the first line of cscript files.

    Documented these help commands in "help help":

	help ->
	help *
	help .
	help %
	help //
	help #

    The usage help file is now formed from the contents of the calc man page.
    So "help usage" prints the version of the calc man page.  Added ${COL}
    makefile symbol to support the formation of the calc.usage file from
    calc.1 via the CALCPAGER (less) or NROFF (if NROFF is non-empty).

    The "help calc" command is now equivalent to "help help".

    The "help define" command is now equivalent to "help command".

    Fixed calc command line usage message.

    Fixed missing README.src file in RPM src and tgz src tarball.

    Removed HAVE_SNPRINTF test in version.c.  We now assume that
    all systems come with the standard snprintf() library function.

    Make does not assume that DONT_HAVE_VSPRINTF must be defined in
    order to test for varargs (via have_varvs.c).  Instead it uses the
    ${HAVE_VSPRINTF} to determine if the vsprintf() and vsnprintf()
    should be tested to assumed to exist or not exist.

    Tests for the existence of vsprintf() now also require the existence
    of vsnprintf().  Test for the existence of vsnprintf() now also
    require the existence of vsprintf().

    The #define CALC_SIZE_T was never used except when memmove() was
    not found.  This symbol was renamed to MEMMOVE_SIZE_T.  Calc
    requires that size_t must be a known type.

    Calc and cscripts are installed mode 0755 instead of 0555 to
    make rpmlint happy.

    Make clobber cleanup as suggested by Martin Buck <m at rtin-buck dot de>.
    The clobber rule now depends on the clean rule.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.1.6 to 2.12.1.7:

    Added the calc builtin function, usertime(), to return the amount of
    user CPU time used by the current process.  Unlike the old runtime()
    builtin, the CPU time reported for long running processes will not
    wrap around to 0 after only a few months.

    Added the calc built0in function, systime(), to return the amount of
    kernel CPU time used by the current process.

    The runtime() builtin function now returns the total amount of CPU
    time used by the current process.  This time includes both user mode
    and kernel mode time.  Unlike the old runtime() builtin, the builtin
    includes time spent executing operating system code on behalf of
    the current process.

    Fixed runtime() so that the CPU time reported for long running
    processes will wrap around to 0 for a long time.

    Added config("hz") to return the clock tick rate.  This is
    a read-only configuration value.

    Added regression tests for recently added config() parameters.

    Fixed the #define symbols that were created in have_strdup.h.
    Previously this file looked as if have_rusage.h has been
    included already.

    Restored the function of "help" (without any args) printing the
    default help file.  Thanks for this fix goes to Silvan Minghetti
    <bullet at users dot sourceforge dot net>.

    Fixed a problem where some old MS environments failed some of the
    regression tests because "read -once foo.cal" was not behaving
    correctly due to how the _fullpath() was being called.  Thanks for
    this fix goes to Anatoly <notexistent-anb at yandex dot ru>.

    Documented the mis-feature about how calc parses if, for, while
    and do statements in an unexpected way.   For example:

	This works as expected:

	    if (expr) {
		...
	    }

	However this WILL NOT WORK AS EXPECTED:

	    if (expr)
	    {
		...
	    }

	because calc will parse the if being terminated by
	an empty statement followed by a

	    if (expr) ;
	    {
		...
	    }

    See also "help statement", "help unexpected", "help todo", and
    "help bugs".


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.1 to 2.12.1.5:

    Fixed minor typos in the 'version 2.12.0 to 2.12.0.8' section below.
    Made minor formatting changes as well.

    Changed use of ${Q} in the Makefile to avoid an make "feature"
    related to OpenBSD.  Added ${RM} make variable for make tools that
    do not have builtin defined terms.

    Removed the ECHO_PROG Makefile variable.  Also removed it from
    the sysinfo() custom function.

    Improved the support for cross-compiled environments by using
    make symbols for all non-shell commands executed by Makefiles.

    Fixed a problem with the make chk awk script which failed under
    OS X 10.4.7.

    Fixed a few minor variables that were not set to default values in
    lower level Makefiles.

    Fixed a reference to a non-existent make variable in HOWTO.INSTALL.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.12.0 to 2.12.0.8:

    Fixed ellip.cal to deal with a calc syntax change that happened
    many ages ago but was never applied to this file until now.
    This bug was fixed by Ernest Bowen <ebowen at une dot edu dot au>.

    Fixed a problem where comments using # followed by a !, newline or
    another # works.  This bug was fixed by Ernest Bowen <ebowen at une
    dot edu dot au>.

    The show builtins display for functions with long descriptions
    is now broken into multi-line descriptions.

    The str functions, such as strcpy(s1, s2), will now copy as many
    characters as possible from s2 to s1, treating '\0' like any other
    character until the end of s2 is reached. If s2 is shorter than s1,
    a '\0' is inserted.

    The strcmp(s1, s2) builtin, for strings s1, s2: strcmp(s1, s2) == 0 now
    means the same as s1 == s2.

    The str(s) builtin has been changed so that it will return only the
    string formed by the characters of 's' up to the first '\0'.

    The substr(s, start, num) builtin has been changed so that '\0' characters
    are treated like any other.

    Fixed a bug where strcpy("", "a") used to cause a segmentation fault.
    This bug was fixed by Ernest Bowen <ebowen at une dot edu dot au>.

    Make minor change to natnumset.cal in how the tail variable is initialized.

    Fixed bugs in the strcmp, strncmp, strcpy, and strncpy help files.
    This bug was fixed by Ernest Bowen <ebowen at une dot edu dot au>.

    Added cal/screen.cal which Defines ANSI control sequences providing
    (i.e., cursor movement, changing foreground or background color,
    etc.) for VT100 terminals and terminal window emulators (i.e., xterm,
    Apple OS/X Terminal, etc.) that support them.  For example:

	; read screen
	; print green:"This is green. ":red:"This is red.":black

    Fixed a bug where too many open files returned E_FOPEN3.  Now
    a new error symbol F_MANYOPEN is used for too many open files.

    Added the builtin function fpathopen() to open a file while
    searching along a path:

	; fd2 = fpathopen("tmp/date", "r", ".:~:~sc:/tmp:/var/tmp:/var")
	; print fd2
	"/var/tmp/date"

    By default, fpathopen() searches along CALCPATH.

    Added the calcpath() builtin function to return the current value
    of CALCPATH.

    Fixed prompt characters in the EXAMPLE section of help files.

    Fixed problems related to the protect function and its documentation.
    This bug was reported by David Gilham <davidgilham at gmail dot com>.
    This bug was fixed by Ernest Bowen <ebowen at une dot edu dot au>.

    Raised the limit of exponent in exponential notation.  It was set to
    arbitrary 1000000 (making 1e1000001 in invalid exponential notation
    value).  The exponent for exponential notation is now int(MAXLONG/10).
    On 32 bit machines, this means a limit of 214748364.  On 64 bit
    machines, this means 922337203685477580.  Of course, you may not
    have enough memory to hold such huge values, but if you did you can
    now express such values in exponential notation.

    Added log() builtin for base 10 logarithm.

    Fixed problems where internal use of libc strcpy() might have caused
    a buffer overflow.  Calc now only uses libc strcpy() when the source
    string is a constant.

    The calc STRING and STRINGHEAD now use the standard size_t (an unsigned
    type) length.  Calc mostly uses size_t in dealing with string lengths
    and object sizes when possible.

    Added ${CCWERR} make variable to allow one to force compiler warnings
    to be treated as errors.  The ${CC} make variable now uses ${CCWERR}
    however the ${LCC} (used by the Makefile test code for building hsrc
    files) does not use ${CCWERR}.  By default, ${CCWERR} is empty.
    In development Makefiles, we set CCWERR= -Werror to force us to
    address compiler warnings before the next release.

    The calc make variable, CALCPAGER, now defaults to CALCPAGER= less
    because the less utility is now very common.  Set CALCPAGER= more
    if you do not have less.

    Calc source had two styles of switch indentation.  Converted the
    style where case statements were indented with respect to the switch
    statement into the style where the case statements are at the same
    level.  When comparing with older source, one may use the -b argument
    of the diff command to ignore changes in amount of white space:

	diff -b -r -u calc-2.11.11 calc-2.12.0

    The read, write, and help commands use the value of global string
    variable if the symbol name starts with a $.  For example:

	global x = "lucas.cal";
	read $x;	/* same as read lucas.cal or read "lucas.cal" */

    Added dotest.cal resource.  Based on a design by Ernest Bowen
    <ebowen at une dot edu dot au>, the dotest evaluates individual
    lines from a file.  The dotest() function takes 1 to 3 arguments:

	dotest(dotest_file [,dotest_code [,dotest_maxcond]])

	dotest_file

	    Search along CALCPATH for dotest_file, which contains lines that
	    should evaluate to 1.  Comment lines and empty lines are ignored.
	    Comment lines should use ## instead of the multi like /* ... */
	    because lines are evaluated one line at a time.

	dotest_code

	    Assign the code number that is to be printed at the start of
	    each non-error line and after **** in each error line.
	    The default code number is 999.

	dotest_maxcond

	    The maximum number of error conditions that may be detected.
	    An error condition is not a sign of a problem, in some cases
	    a line deliberately forces an error condition.  A value of -1,
	    the default, implies a maximum of 2147483647.

	Global variables and functions must be declared ahead of time because
	the dotest scope of evaluation is a line at a time.  For example:

	    ; read dotest.cal
	    ; read set8700.cal
	    ; dotest("set8700.line");

    Updated the todo / wish list items.  The top priority now is to
    convert calc to GNU autoconf / configure to build the calc.

	; help todo

    Added missing help file for the stoponerror() builtin.

    Corrected and improved the help documentation for factor and lfactor.

    Fixed a problem where some error messages that should have been
    written to a file or string, went to stderr instead.  This bug was
    fixed by Ernest Bowen <ebowen at une dot edu dot au>.

    Corrected the documentation relating to the calc -c command line option.
    The -c relates to scan/parse errors only, not execution errors.

    Corrected a stack overflow problem where the math_fmt() in zio.c
    could be induced to overflow the stack.  This problem was independently
    reported by Chew Keong Tan of Secunia Research <vuln at secunia dot com>.

    Corrected a stack overflow problem where the scanerror() in token.c
    could be induced to overflow the stack by a malformed token.

    Made math_error() in math_error.c more robust against a error
    message constant that is too long.

    Made read_bindings() in hist.c more robust against very long bindings
    config lines.

    Made listsort() in listfunc.c and matsort() matfunc.c more robust
    against sorting of impossibly huge lists and matrices.

    Warnings about an undefining a builtin or undefined function, a
    constant before the comma operator, and an unterminated comment is
    now processed by scanerrors (not simply written directly to stderr).
    These warnings file and line number in which the "error" occurred
    as well as a more precise message than before.  If using -c on the
    calc command line or if stoponerror(-1), then assuming there are
    no other compile errors, only the unterminated comment will stop
    completion of the function being defined.

    The cal/regress.cal now reads most of the calc resource files.

    The issq() test had a slight performance boost.  A minor note
    was added to the help/issq file.

    Improved the documentation of the mul2, sq2, pow2, and redc2 config
    parameters in help/config.

    Added config("baseb"), a read-only configuration value to return
    the number of bits in the fundamental base in which calculations
    are performed.  This is a read-only configuration value.

    Calc now will allow syntax such as ++*p-- and  ++*----*++p----
    where p is an lvalue; successful evaluation of course require the
    successive operations to be performed to have operands of appropriate
    types; e.g. in *A, A is usually an lvalue whose current value is a
    pointer. ++ and -- act on lvalues. In the above examples there are
    implied parentheses from the beginning to immediately after p. If
    there are no pre ++ or -- operations, as in **p++.  The implied
    parentheses are from immediately before p to the end.

    Improved the error message when && is used as a prefix operator.

    Changed the help/config file to read like a builtin function help file.

    One can no longer set to 1, or to a value < 0, the config()
    parameters: "mul2", "sq2", "pow2", and "redc2".  These values
    in the past would result in improper configuration of internal
    calc algorithms.  Changed cal/test4100.cal to use the minimal
    value of 2 for "pow2", and "redc2".

    Changed the default values for the following config() parameters:

	config("mul2") == 1780
	config("sq2") == 3388
	config("pow2") == 176

	These values were determined established on a 1.8GHz AMD 32-bit
	CPU of ~3406 BogoMIPS by the new resource file:

	    cal/alg_config.cal

   Regarding the alg_config.cal resource file:

	The best_mul2() function returns the optimal value of config("mul2").
	The best_sq2() function returns the optimal value of config("sq2").
	The best_pow2() function returns the optimal value of config("pow2").
	The other functions are just support functions.

	By design, best_mul2(), best_sq2(), and best_pow2() take a few
	minutes to run.  These functions increase the number of times a
	given computational loop is executed until a minimum amount of CPU
	time is consumed.  To watch these functions progress, one can set
	the config("user_debug") value.

	Here is a suggested way to use the alg_config.cal resource file:

	    ; read alg_config
	    ; config("user_debug",2),;
	    ; best_mul2(); best_sq2(); best_pow2();
	    ; best_mul2(); best_sq2(); best_pow2();
	    ; best_mul2(); best_sq2(); best_pow2();

	NOTE: It is perfectly normal for the optimal value returned
	to differ slightly from run to run.  Slight variations due to
	inaccuracy in CPU timings will cause the best value returned to
	differ slightly from run to run.

	See "help resource" for more information on alg_config.cal.

    Updated the "help variable" text to reflect the current calc
    use of ` (backquote), * (star), and & (ampersand).

    Removal of some restrictions on the use of the same identifier
    for more than one of parameter, local, static or global variable.

	For example, at command level, one could use:

	    for (local x = 0; x < 10; x++) print sqrt(x);

	At the beginning of a statement, "(global A)" is a way of
	indicating a reference to the variable A, whereas "global A"
	would be taken as a declaration. Parentheses are not required in
	"++global A" or "global A++" when "global" is used in this way.

	The patch extends this "specifier" (or "qualifier") feature
	to static variables, but such that "static A" refers only
	to a static variable at the current file and function scope
	levels. (If there is already a static variable A at the current
	file and function levels, a declaration statement "static A"
	would end the scope of that variable and define a new static
	variable with identifier A. A "global A" declaration is more
	drastic in that it ends the scope of any static variable A at
	the same or higher scope levels.)

	Unlike a static declaration in which an "initialization" occurs at
	most once, in the specifier case, "static A = expr" is simply an
	assignment which may be repeated any number of times.  An example
	of its use is:

	    define np() = static a = nextprime(a);

	For n not too large, the n-th call to this function will
	return the n-th prime. The variable a here will be private to
	the function.

	Because one can use "global", "local" or "static" to specify a
	type of variable, there seems little point in restricting the
	ways identifiers that can be used in more than one of these
	or as parameters. Obviously, introducing A as a local variable
	when it is being used as a parameter can lead to confusion and a
	warning is appropriate, but if it is to be used only occasionally,
	it might be convenient to be able to refer to it as "local A"
	rather than introducing another identifier. While it may be
	silly to use the same identifier for both a parameter and local
	variable, it should not be illegal.

    Added warnings for possibly questionable code in function definitions.

    Added config("redecl_warn", boolean) to control if calc issues
    warnings about variables being declared.  The config("redecl_warn")
    value is TRUE by default.

    Added config("dupvar_warn", boolean) to control if calc issues
    warnings about when variable names collide.  The config("dupvar_warn")
    value is TRUE by default.  Examples of variable name collisions
    include when:

	* both local and static variables have the same name
	* both local and global variables have the same name
	* both function parameter and local variables have the same name
	* both function parameter and global variables have the same name

    Fix of a bug which causes some static variables not to be correctly
    unscoped when their identifiers are used in a global declaration.

    Change of "undefine" from a command-level keyword to statement level and
    introduction of an "undefine static A" statement to end the scope of a
    static variable A at the current file/function levels.

    Change/restored the syntax rules for "for" and "while" loops to
    recognize an unescaped newline in top-level command-level statements.

    Updated help/avg, help/define, help/fprintf, help/gcd, help/hash,
    help/hmean, help/lcm, help/max, help/min, help/null, help/poly,
    help/printf, help/ssq, help/strcat, help/strprintf, help/sum,
    help/xor.

    Changed the definition of the function ssq() to enable list arguments
    to be processed in the same way as in sum().  For example:

	ssq(1,2, list(3,4,list(5,6)), list(), 7, 8)

    returns the value of 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 8^2 == 204.

    Added the calc resource sumtimes.cal, to give the runtimes for
    various ways of evaluating sums, sums of squares, etc, for large
    lists and matrices.  For example:

	read sumtimes
	doalltimes(1e6)

    Calc now ignores carriage returns (\r), vertical tabs (\v), and
    form feeds (\f) when token parsing.  Thus users on Windows systems
    can write files using their \r\n format and users on non-Windows
    systems can read them without errors.

    The quomod() builtin function now takes an optional 5th argument
    which controls the rounding mode like config("quomod") does, but
    only for that call.  Now quomod() is in line with quo() and mod()
    in that the final argument is an optional rounding mode.

    Added a "make uninstall" rule which will attempt to remove everything
    that was installed by a "make install".

    Changed the "Copyright" line in the rpm spec file to a "License" line
    as per new rpm v4.4 syntax.

    The quomod() builtin function does not allow constants for its 3rd
    and 4th arguments.  Updated the "help quomod" file and added more
    quomod regression tests.

    Added patch from Ernest Bowen <ebowen at une dot edu dot au> to
    add the builtin: estr().  The estr(x) will return a representation
    of a null, string, real number, complex number, list, matrix,
    object. block, named block, error as a string.

    Added patch from Ernest Bowen <ebowen at une dot edu dot au> to
    add the builtin: fgetfile().  The fgetfile(x) will return the rest
    of an open file as a string.

    Improved help files for fgetfield, fputs, name, or quomod.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.10.1 to 2.11.11:

    Fixed a bug reported by the sourceforge user: cedars where:

	ln(exp(6)) == 3		/* WRONG!!! */

    incorrectly returned 1.  This bug was fixed by Ernest Bowen
    <ebowen at une dot edu dot au>.  The regression test
    was expanded to cover this issue.

    Added minor improvements to hash regression testing of pi().

    Fixed "help script" and the calc man page regarding the requirement
    of -f to be the last -flag in shell script mode.  Further clarified
    the meaning and placement of the -f flag.

    Moved issues with chi.cal intfile.cal into a "mis-features" section
    of the BUGS file.  See "help bugs" or the BUGS source file for details.

    Added the bug about:

	calc 'read ellip; efactor(13*17*19)'

    to the BUGS file.  See "help bugs" or the BUGS source file for details.
    Anyone want to track down and fix this bug?

    Fixed typo in the "help mat" example and improved the mat_print example.

    Renamed most COMPLEX C function names to start with c_ to avoid
    conflicts with new C standard functions.  Note that the calc
    builtin function names remain the same.   The C function names
    inside the C source that calc is written in changed.  This means
    that code that linked to libcalc.a will need to change in order
    to call calc's functions instead of the C standard functions.
    See cmath.h, comfunc.c, and commath.c for details.  See also
    http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/complex.h.html
    for names of the new C standard functions.

    Changed the calc man page to note that using -- in the command will
    separate calc options from arguments as in:

	calc -p -- -1 - -7

    Noted how Apple OS X can make use of readline in the Makefile.
    In particular:

	# For Apple OS X: install fink from http://fink.sourceforge.net
	#                 and then do a 'fink install readline' and then use:
	#
	READLINE_LIB= -L/sw/lib -lreadline -lhistory -lncurses

    Added linear.cal as a calc standard resource file.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.10 to 2.11.10:

    The cygwin config value is correctly tested while doing comparisons
    between config states.

    Added config("compile_custom") to determine if calc was compiled
    with -DCUSTOM.  By default, the Makefile uses ALLOW_CUSTOM= -DCUSTOM
    so by default, config("compile_custom") is TRUE.  If, however,
    calc is compiled without -DCUSTOM, then config("compile_custom")
    will be FALSE.  NOTE: The config("compile_custom") value is only
    affected by compile flags.  The calc -D runtime command line option
    does not change the config("compile_custom") value.  This is a
    read-only configuration value.

    Added config("allow_custom") to determine if the use of custom
    functions are allowed.  To allow the use of custom functions, calc
    must be compiled with -DCUSTOM (which it is by default) AND calc run
    be run with the -D runtime command line option (which it is not by
    default).  If config("allow_custom") is TRUE, then custom functions
    are allowed.  If config("allow_custom") is FALSE, then custom
    functions are not allowed.  This is a read-only configuration value.

    Correctly hash config state for windows and cygwin values.  The value
    of config("compile_custom") and config("allow_custom") also affect
    the hash of the config state.

    Fixed the custom/argv.cal test code to avoid use of a reserved
    builtin function name.

    Fixed custom/*.cal scripts to conform better with the cal/*.cal
    resource files.

    Removed the Makefile variables ${LONGLONG_BITS}, ${HAVE_LONGLONG},
    and ${L64_FORMAT}.  Removed longlong.c and longlong.h.  The use
    of HAVE_LONGLONG=0 was problematic.  The lack of complaints about
    the HAVE_LONGLONG=0 shows that the 'long long' type is wide spread
    enough to warrant not trying to support compilers without 'long long'.

    Removed the SVAL and SHVAL macros from zrand.c, zrand.h, and zmath.h
    as they were causing too many broken C pre-processors and C checkers
    to become confused.

    Added a 'make splint' rule to use the splint statically checking
    tool on the calc source.

    Removed support of the BSDI platform.  The BSDI platform is no longer
    directly supported and we lost our last BSDI machine on which we
    could test calc.  Best wishes to the former BSDI folk and thanks
    for breaking important ground in the Open Source Movement!

    Fixed several typos found in the documentation and builtin
    function output by C Smith <smichr at hotmail dot com>.

    Fixed -d so that:

	calc -d 2/3

    will print 0.66666666666666666667 without the leading tilde as
    advertised in the man page.

    Added a missing help file for the display builtin function as
    requested by Igor Furlan <primorec at sbcglobal dot net>.

    Changed the "help environment" file to reflect modern default
    values of CALCPATH and CALCRC.

    Added missing variables for printing by the "make env" rule.

    Added EXT Makefile variable so that Cygwin can install calc as
    calc.exe.  By default, EXT is empty so that calc is calc on most
    modern operating systems.  Thanks goes to Ullal Devappa Kini <wmbfqj
    at vsnl dot net> for helping identify this problem and testing our fix.

    Added custom function:

	custom("pmodm127", q)

    to compute 2^(2^127-1) mod q.  While currently slower than just
    doing pmod(2,2^127-1,q), it is added to give an example of a
    more complex custom function.  Call calc with the -C flag to
    use custom functions.

    Made slight changes to the custom/HOW_TO_ADD documentation.

    Fixed some \ formatting man page problems as reported by Keh-Cheng
    Chu <kehcheng at quake dot Stanford dot edu>.

    Fixed some comparison between signed and unsigned in md5.c
    that was reported for the PowerMac G5 2GHz MacOS 10.3 by
    Guillaume VERGNAUD <vergnaud at via dot ecp dot fr>.

    Fixed a number of pending issues with help files filling in
    missing  LIMITS, LINK LIBRARY, and SEE ALSO information,


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.9 to 2.11.9.3:

    Fixed calc man page examples to move -f to the end of the line.
    Thanks goes to Michael Somos for pointing this out.

    Linux and gcc now compiled with -Wall -W -Wno-comment.

    Fixed a post increment that was reported by R. Trinler <trinler at
    web dot de> and fixed by Ernest Bowen <ernie at turing dot une dot
    edu dot au>.

    Fixed pi.cal to not depend on the buggy pre-2.11.9 post increment
    behavior.

    Added config("cygwin") to determine if calc was compiled under Cygwin.
    The config("cygwin") is a read-only configuration value that is 1
    when calc was compiled under Cygwin and 0 otherwise.  Regression
    tests 949 and 950 are skipped when config("cygwin") is true.

    The Makefile variable HAVE_NO_IMPLICIT is empty by default so that
    the Makefile will test if the compiler has a -Wno-implicit flag.

    Added HAVE_UNUSED Makefile variable.  If HAVE_UNUSED is empty,
    then the Makefile will run the have_unused program to determine
    if the unused attribute is supported.  If HAVE_UNUSED is set to
    -DHAVE_NO_UNUSED, then the unused attribute will not be used.

    The Makefile builds have_unused.h which defines, if the unused
    attribute is supported:

	#define HAVE_UNUSED /* yes */
	#define UNUSED __attribute__((unused)) /* yes */

    or defines, if the unused is not supported (or if the Makefile
    variable is HAVE_UNUSED= -DHAVE_NO_UNUSED):

	#undef HAVE_UNUSED /* no */
	#define UNUSED /* no */

    Fixed numerous warnings about comparison between signed and unsigned
    value warnings and unused parameter warnings in version.c, zrand.c,
    string.c, shs1.c, shs.c, qtrans.c, qmath.c, qfunc.c, md5.c, matfunc.c,
    hist.c, file.c, const.c, blkcpy.c, seed.c, opcodes.c, func.c, qio.c,
    zrandom.c, custom/c_argv.c, custom/c_devnull.c, custom/c_help.c,
    custom/c_sysinfo.c, addop.c and calc.c.

    Fixed some typos in this file.

    By default, compile with -O3 -g3.  The Makefile comments on how some
    distributions might need to use -O2 -g or -O -g.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.8.0 to 2.11.8.1:

    Updated HOWTO.INSTALL to reflect the new RPM files.

    Clarify that the internal hash as well as the hash builtin
    function used by calc, while based on the Fowler/Noll/Vo
    hash is NOT an FNV hash.

    Made slight performance improvements to calc by an optimization of how
    calc's internal hash is computed.  The "make chk" regression test
    runs about 1.5% faster (when compiled with -O3 on an AMD Athlon)
    NO_HASH_CPU_OPTIMIZATION is not defined.  Calc's internal hash values
    have not changed.  By default, NO_HASH_CPU_OPTIMIZATION is NOT defined
    and the slightly faster expression is used.

    A slight modification of what was known as the "calc new standard"
    configuration (calc -n or config("all", "newstd")) is now the default
    calc configuration.  The flag:

	calc -O

    was added to get the old classic calc configuration.  The flag command
    line flag, -n, now does nothing.  Use of -n is deprecated and may go
    away / be used for something else in the future.

    The following table gives the summary of these changes:

	     pre v2.11.8		     v2.11.8
	     default         pre v2.11.8     -O & oldstd      v2.11.8
	     and oldstd	     -n & newstd     classic cfg      default
	     --------------------------------------------------------
    epsilon	1e-20		1e-10		1e-20		1e-20
    quo		2		2		2		2
    outround	2		24		2		24
    leadzero	0		1		0		1
    fullzero	0		1		0		0
    prompt	>		;		>		;
    more	>>		;;		>>		;;

    With the exception of epsilon being 1e-20, and fullzero being unset,
    the new default calc config is like it was (pre-2.11.8) with calc -n /
    config("all", "newstd").

    The new default config is the old classic config with outround being
    24, leadzero being set, and the prompts being ;'s.

    Fixed a bug in the evaluation of tanh(1e-23) with an epsilon(1e-100).
    Thanks goes to Dmitry G. Baksheyev <bd at nbsp dot nsk dot su>
    for reporting the problem, and thanks goes to Ernest Bowen
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au> for the fix.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.7.0 to 2.11.7.1:

    Added support to build calc RPMs thanks to Petteri Kettunen
    <petterik at users dot sourceforge dot net>.

    Added rpm rule to Makefile to build rpm set.  The rpm rule
    uses the rpm.mk Makefile and the calc.spec.in spec template.

    The default Makefile is now the Makefile used during rpm
    creation.  This Makefile assumes that system has readline,
    ncurses (-lreadline -lhistory -lncurses), and less.
    It compiled with a high gcc optimization level (-O3 -g3).
    The Makefile used during rpm creation is the Makefile
    that appears in the calc-src rpm as well.

    The Makefile shipped with the old style gziped tarball
    is still the same generic Makefile.

    The Makefile now uses ${MKDIR} ${MKDIR_ARG} when creating
    directories during installation.  By default, it does
    a mkdir -p when forming directories.

    Fixed attributes on include and lib calc-devel files.

    Adjusted the interaction between rpm.mk, and the calc.spec.in.
    Release number now comes from calc.spec.in only.

    Renamed calc and calc-devel RPMs to use .i686 instead of .i386.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.6.3 to date:

    Fixed a bug in deg.cal where fixdms() was being called with
    the wrong type of argument.

    Changed the value of digits(1) and digits(0) to be 1.  Now digits()
    returns number of digits in the standard base-b representation
    when x is truncated to an integer and the sign is ignored.
    To be more precise: when abs(int(x)) > 0, this function returns
    the value 1 + ilog(x, b).  When abs(int(x)) == 0, then this
    function returns the value 1.

    As the result of the above digits() change, the repeat.cal
    resource file script was modified to remove the special
    case for repeating a value of 1.  Also the regress tests
    #715, #977 and #978 were changed.

    Made a minor improvement to the "help places" documentation.

    Fixed dms_neg(a) in deg.cal thanks to a bug report by kaa
    <kaa76 at pochtamt dot ru>.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.6.0 to 2.11.6.2:

    Clarified remark in lucas.cal about use of n mod 2^n == 0.

    Fixed help typos reported by Marc Mezzarobba <mm at mm dot ovh dot org>.

    Forced system("") to return 0 under Windows.

    The direct.h include file is not used when compiling under Cygwin.

    Fixed bug where random(10,11) caused calc to dump core when issued
    the 2nd time.

    Moved the setting of the Makefile variable ${CALC_INCDIR} to
    the section where things like ${BINDIR} and ${LIBDIR} are set.
    Idea from Clifford Kite <kite_public1 at ev1 dot net>.

    The Makefile is shipped mode 0644 since a number of folks
    edit it (to build and check calc) as a non-root user and later
    on su to root to install.  Idea from Clifford Kite <kite_public1
    at ev1 dot net>.

    Added base2() builtin function to calc.  Normally calc prints
    values according to base().  Frequently some users want to see
    a value in two bases.  Flipping back and forth between to bases
    is a bit of a pain.  With base2(), calc will output a value twice:

	; 234567
		234567
	; base2(16),
	; 234567
		234567 /* 0x39447 */
	; 131072
		131072 /* 0x20000 */
	; base2(0),
	; 131072
        131072

    By default, base2() is disabled.  Calling base2(0) will also turn
    off the double base mode.  Thanks goes to Erik Anggard
    <erik dot anggard at packetfront dot com> for his idea and
    his initial patch.

    Added repeat.cal as a calc resource file script:

	repeat(digit_set, repeat_count)

	Return the value of the digit_set repeated repeat_count times.
	Both digit_set and repeat_count must be integers > 0.

	For example repeat(423,5) returns the value 423423423423423,
	which is the digit_set 423 repeated 5 times.

    Makefile no longer makes a direct reference to Red Hat 6.0.

    Added missing math_setmode2() prototype to zmath.h.

    Fixed some implicit declarations of functions by either making
    them explicit or by including the proper system .h files.

    Makefile no longer uses -Wno-implicit flag, by default, for
    gcc based compiles on calc source.  Makefile now attempts to
    compile no_implicit.c with an explicit -Wno-implicit arg in an
    effort to determine of -Wno-implicit is a valid compiler flag.
    If no_implicit.c is compiled with -Wno-implicit, then
    the file no_implicit.arg is created with the contents
    of the -Wno-implicit flag.  Otherwise no_implicit.arg
    is created as an empty file.

    Added the Makefile variable ${HAVE_NO_IMPLICIT}, which if
    not set to YES will prevent no_implicit.c from being
    compiled and prevent the -Wno-implicit flag from being used.
    If ${HAVE_NO_IMPLICIT} is not YES, then an empty no_implicit.arg
    file is created and no_implicit.c is not compiled.

    The seed.c file, because the pseudo_seed() function contains
    calls to a number of various system functions, attempts to
    compile with the -Wno-implicit flag (if allowed by the
    formation of the no_implicit.arg file).

    Misc make depend fixes and cleanup.

    Fixed formation of the custom/.all file.

    Fixed repeat(1, repeat_count) bug.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.5.5 to 2.11.5.9:

    Now using version numbers of one of these forms:

	x.y.z.w
	x.y.z
	x.y

    Changed the READLINE_LIB Makefile variable to not link with -lreadline
    by default.  If you do have readline, we recommend that you use it.
    If you can install the GNU readline:

	http://freshmeat.net/projects/gnureadline/
	http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html

    we recommend it.  But if not, you should set the USE_READLINE,
    READLINE_LIB, and READLINE_INCLUDE Makefile variables to empty.
    NOTE: See the BUGS file for a Linux issue when compiling calc
    with -O (or -O2 or -O3) AND with -g (or -g3) AND with readline.

    Removed an obsolete reference to TOPDIR.  This was fixed thanks to
    a bug report by Clifford Kite <kite_public1 at ev1 dot net>.
    Fixed other inconsistencies related to things like BINDIR.

    Fixed calc man page so that is refers to -f instead of the old -S flag.
    Fixed thanks to Clifford Kite <kite_public1 at ev1 dot net> for
    point this out.

    All for loops end with /dev/null to avoid any problems related
    to systems that cannot grok empty for loops.

    Changed the libcalc functions creal and cimag to c_real and c_imag
    to about conflicts with new libc such as those used by gcc v3.
    Thanks Eli Zaretskii <eliz at is dot elta dot co dot il> and
    Martin Buck <m at rtin-buck dot de> for alerting us to this conflict.

    The Makefile no longer hard code's /usr/include.  Instead it uses
    the ${INCDIR} Makefile variable.  Thanks goes to Eli Zaretskii
    <eliz at is dot elta dot co dot il> for pointing out this inconsistency.

    Added mods to support compilation under DJGPP.  DJGPP runs on 386
    and newer PCs running DOS or dos-compatible operating systems.
    See http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/.  Thanks goes to Eli Zaretskii
    <eliz at is dot elta dot co dot il> for sending in these mods.

    Updated README.WINDOWS to include information on building with DJGPP.

    The pld folks are building RPMs based on our calc distributions.
    See:  ftp://ftp.pld.org.pl/dists/ra/PLD/i686/PLD/RPMS or
    http://ftp.pld.org.pl/dists/ra/PLD/i686/PLD/RPMS more information.
    We appreciate their work in this regard.  In the next release, we
    plan to also build and release our own RPMs based on their efforts.

    Changed the Makefile variable CUSTOMLIBDIR to CUSTOMCALDIR.
    Changed the Makefile variable CSHAREDIR to CALC_SHAREDIR.
    Changed the Makefile variable INCDIRCALC to CALC_INCDIR.
    Removed the Makefile variable SHAREDIR.

    Updated the HOWTO.INSTALL and README.WINDOWS files.

    Fixed definition of MAXUFULL.  Thanks to a bus report from
    Jill Poland <jpoland at cadence dot com>.

The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.5t4.1 to 2.11.5t4.4:

    Updated dependency rules in Makefiles.

    NOTE: -DSRC, as used in 2.11.5t4.1 was renamed -DCALC_SRC
    in a later version.

    Calc include files use #include "foo.h" to include other calc
    header files if -DCALC_SRC.  Otherwise they use <calc/foo.h>.
    The -DCALC_SRC symbol is defined by default in calc's Makefile
    and so it uses the header files from within the calc src tree.
    If an external non-calc program includes an installed calc
    header file (from under /usr/include), and it does NOT define
    CALC_SRC, then it will obtain the calc header files from the
    correct system location (such as /usr/include/calc/foo.h).

    Added calc builtin function: version() which returns the calc
    version string.

    Added subject requirements for the calc-tester-request and
    calc-bugs-mail Email aliases.  See:

	http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/calc/email.html

    for details.

    Corrected a bug that incorrectly set the default calc path
    back in version 2.11.5t4.  The default CALCPATH is now:

	.:./cal:~/.cal:/usr/share/calc:/usr/share/calc/custom

    and the default CALCRC is now:

	/usr/share/calc/startup:~/.calcrc:./.calcinit

    This fixes the missing bindings error and it places the calc
    resource files into the default path.

    If you are using the GNU readline then the Makefile recommends that
    you link with the ncurses library.

    Applied Makefile, cscript/Makefile and custom/Makefile patches to
    fix install mode problems, to deal with sorting and dates in I18n
    environments (such as Japanese), to fix some problems with calc.spec
    and to fix the cscript #! header lines.  Thanks goes to KAWAMURA Masao
    (kawamura at mlb.co.jp) for the bug report and patch!

    Fixed headers on fproduct.calc powerterm.calc 4dsphere.calc so
    that they are correctly changed on installation.

    Added ${GREP} Makefile variable.

    The top level Makefile now sets LANG=C and passes it down to
    lower level Makefiles.

    Updated URLs in cal/lucas.cal comments.

    Now shipping calc.spec, inst_files, spec-template and Makefile.linux
    with the standard calc source distribution.  Note that the standard
    Makefile has not changed.  The Makefile.linux only in minor ways
    needed to build calc rpms.

    Added $T Makefile variable.  $T is the top level directory under
    which calc will be installed.  The calc install is performed under $T,
    the calc build is performed under /.  The purpose for $T is to allow
    someone to install calc somewhere other than into the system area.
    For example when forming the calc rpm, the Makefile is called with
    T=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT.  If $T is empty, calc is installed under /.

    Removed all echo_XYZ rules except for echo_inst_files from lower
    level makefile.  The calc.spec will use a make install rule
    with T=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT.

    Updated LIBRARY file with instructions related to -DCALC_SRC,
    the new default include file location and -lcustcalc.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.5t3 to 2.11.5t4:

    The Makefile will now send both stdout and stderr to /dev/null
    when compiling hsrc intermediates.

    The config("verbose_quit") value was restored to a default
    value of FALSE.

    Added the cscript:

	powerterm [base_limit] value

    to write the value as the sum (or difference) of powers <= base_limit
    where base_limit by default is 10000.

    Applied a bug fix by Dr.D.J.Picton <dave at aps5.ph.bham.ac.uk>
    to have help with no args print the default help file.

    Renamed lavarand to LavaRnd.

    Added rules to build a calc rpm.

    All installed files are first formed as foo.new, and then moved
    into place as foo via a atomic rename.

    During installation, only files that are different are installed.
    If the built file and the installed file are the same, no
    installation is performed.

    Calc has new default installation locations:

    Makefile var   old location			      new location
    ------------   ------------			      ------------
    TOPDIR	   /usr/local/lib		        <<no longer used>>
    BINDIR	   /usr/local/bin		      /usr/bin
    SHAREDIR	      <<not set>>		      /usr/share
    INCDIR	   /usr/local/include		      /usr/include
    LIBDIR	   /usr/local/lib/calc		      /usr/lib
    CSHAREDIR	      <<not set>>		      /usr/share/calc
    HELPDIR	   /usr/local/lib/calc/help           /usr/share/calc/help
    INCDIRCALC	   /usr/local/include/calc	      /usr/include/calc
    CUSTOMLIBDIR   /usr/local/lib/calc/custom	      /usr/share/calc/custom
    CUSTOMHELPDIR  /usr/local/lib/calc/help/custhelp  /usr/share/calc/custhelp
    CUSTOMINCDIR     <<not set>>		      /usr/include/calc/custom
    SCRIPTDIR	   /usr/local/bin/cscript	      /usr/bin/cscript
    MANDIR	     <<not set>>		      /usr/share/man/man1
    CATDIR	     <<not set>>		        <<not set>>

    The Makefile variable ${TOPDIR} is no longer used.  In some places
    it has been replaced by a new Makefile variable ${SHAREDIR}.  Some
    of the old TOPDIR functionality has been replaced by ${CSHAREDIR}.

    The install rules no longer remove old obsolete files.  We assume
    that these old files have long since vanished!  :-)

    Reduced the amount of output when doing a make all where nothing
    needs to be made.

    Reduced the amount of output when doing a make install where nothing
    needs to be installed.

    If you install using the new default locations, you can remove
    old calc files installed in the old default location by doing:

	make olduninstall


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.5t2 to 2.11.5t2.1:

    Fixed a bug, reported by Ernest Bowen <ernie at turing dot
    une dot edu dot au> that caused command lines to be echoed in
    interactive mode.  Fixed a bug that sometimes left the terminal
    in a non-echoing state when calc exited.

    Renamed error codes E_FGETWORD1 and E_FGETWORD2 symbols to
    E_FGETFIELD1 and E_FGETFIELD2.

    Made a minor format change to the top of the calc man page.

    The findid() function in file.c 2nd argument changed.  The argument
    is now mostly a writable flag.  This function now finds the file
    I/O structure for the specified file id, and verifies that
    it is opened in the required manner (0 for reading or 1 for writing).
    If the 2nd argument is -1, then no open checks are made at all and
    NULL is then returned if the id represents a closed file.

    The calc builtin function, fopen(), now allows one to specify
    opening files in binary modes.  On POSIX / Linux / Un*x-like systems,
    text file is the same as a binary file and so 'b' to an fopen has
    no effect and is ignored.  However on systems such as MS Windows
    the 'b' / binary mode has meaning.  See 'help fopen' for details.

    On systems (such as MS Windows), calc will produce a different error
    message when it attempts to open /dev/tty.  This will condition
    will occur in things like calc scripts when they switch from ``batch
    processing'' commands from and want to start interactive mode.

    Regression tests fopen in binary mode in a few places where a
    difference between text and binary string lengths matter.
    The intfile calc resource file also uses binary mode.

    Changed the rand() builtin and its related functions srand() and
    randbit() to use the Subtractive 100 generator instead of the
    additive 55 generator.  This generator as improved random properties.
    As a result, of this change, the values produced by rand(),
    rand() and randbit() are now different.

    Updated regression tests for new rand() and randbit() output.

    Applied a bug fix from Ernest Bowen <ernie at turing dot une dot
    edu dot au> dealing with one-line "static" declaration like:

	static a = 1, b;

    Added regression test 8310 to test for the static bug fix.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.5t0 to 2.11.5t1.1:

    Fixed a compile problem with Linux 2.4 / Debian.  Thanks goes
    to Martin Buck <m at rtin-buck dot de> for help with this issue.

    Fixed a bug in how L64_FORMAT (it determined if "%ld" or "%lld"
    is appropriate for printing of 64 bit long longs) was determined.
    Thanks goes to Martin Buck <m at rtin-buck dot de> for reporting
    this bug and testing the fix.

    An effort was made to make calc easier to build under Windows
    using the Cygwin project (http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/).
    Thanks to the work of Thomas Jones-Low (tjoneslo at softstart
    dot com), a number of #if defined(_WIN32)'s have been added
    to calc source.  These changes should not effect Windows
    free system such as GNU/Linux, Solaris, POSIX-like, etc ...

    Added windll.h to deal with Windows related DLL issues.
    Using the convention of 'extern DLL' instead of 'DLL extern'
    to deal with symbols that export to or import from a DLL.

    Added HAVE_MALLOC_H, HAVE_STDLIB_H, HAVE_STRING_H, HAVE_TIMES_H,
    HAVE_SYS_TIMES_H, HAVE_TIME_H, HAVE_SYS_TIME_H, HAVE_UNISTD_H
    and HAVE_URANDOM to the Makefile.  If these symbols are empty,
    then the Makefile looks for the appropriate system include file.
    If they are YES, then the Makefile will assume they exist.
    If they are NO, then the Makefile will assume they do not exist.

    Changed HAVE_URANDOM to match the empty, YES, NO values.
    If HAVE_URANDOM is empty, then the Makefile will look for /dev/urandom.
    If HAVE_URANDOM is YES, then the Makefile will assume /dev/urandom exists.
    If HAVE_URANDOM is NO, then the Makefile will assume /dev/urandom does
    not exist.

    If TERMCONTROL is -DUSE_WIN32, then the Windows terminal control
    (no TERMIOS, no TERMIO, no SGTTY) will be assumed.

    Added a win32_hsrc Makefile rule to create hsrc files appropriate
    for a Windows system using Cygwin gcc environment.  Added win32.mkdef
    which is used by the win32_hsrc rule to set the Windows specific
    Makefile values to build hsrc files.  The hsrc files are built
    under the win32 directory.

    Added FPOS_POS_BITS, OFF_T_BITS, DEV_BITS and INODE_BITS Makefile
    symbols to allow one to force the size of a file position, file
    offset, dev and inode value.  Leaving these values blank will
    Makefile to determine their size.

    Fixed a bug in the way file offsets, device and inode values are copied.

    Added chi.cal for a initial stab as a Chi^2 function.  The chi_prob()
    function does not work well with odd degrees of freedom, however.

    Added big 3 to config("resource_debug").  Calc resource file scripts
    check for config("resource_debug") & 8 prior to printing internal debug
    statements.  Thus by default they do not print them.

    Added intfile.cal as a calc resource file script:

	file2be(filename)

	    Read filename and return an integer that is built from the
	    octets in that file in Big Endian order.  The first octets
	    of the file become the most significant bits of the integer.

	file2le(filename)

	    Read filename and return an integer that is built from the
	    octets in that file in Little Endian order.  The first octets
	    of the file become the most significant bits of the integer.

	be2file(v, filename)

	    Write the absolute value of v into filename in Big Endian order.
	    The v argument must be on integer.  The most significant bits
	    of the integer become the first octets of the file.

	le2file(v, filename)

	    Write the absolute value of v into filename in Little Endian order.
	    The v argument must be on integer.  The least significant bits
	    of the integer become the last octets of the file.

    Added the following help aliases:

	copy	blkcpy
	read	command
	write	command
	quit	command
	exit	command
	abort	command
	cd	command
	show	command

    Added the cscript:

	fproduct filename term ...

    to write the big Endian product of terms to a filename.  Use - for stdout.

    Fixed calc path in help/script.

    Added read-only parameter, config("windows") to indicate if the system
    is MS windowz WIN32 like system.

    Configuration values that used to return "true" or "false" now return
    1 (a true value) or 0 (a false value).  Thus one can do:

	if (config("tab")) { ... } else { ... }

    The configuration values that now return 1 or 0 are:

	config("tilde")
	config("tab")
	config("leadzero")
	config("blkverbose")
	config("verbose_quit")
	config("windows")

    Now shipping a win32 sub-directory that contains hsrc .h files
    that have been attempted to be built for Windows.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.4t1 to 2.11.4t2:

    Added missing test8600.cal test file.

    Fixes cscript files to deal with the -S flag being replaced by
    -f and possibly other flags.

    Added regression tests for builtin functions bernoulli, catalan,
    euler, freeeuler, and sleep.  Added non-base 10 regression tests
    for digit, digits and places.

    The bernoulli.cal script now just calls the bernoulli() builtin
    function.  It remains for backward compatibility.

    The Makefile now builds have_fpos_pos.h to determine if the
    a non-scalar FILEPOS has a __pos structure element.  If it does,
    the FILEPOS_BITS is taken to be the size of just the __pos element.

    Misc fixes related to non-scalar (e.g., structure) FILEPOS.  Fixed
    a compile problems where non-scalar FILEPOS were incorrectly assigned.

    Fixed make depend rule.

    Return an error on malloc / realloc failures for bernoulli and
    euler functions.

    Added MAKEFILE_REV make variable to help determine Makefile version.
    Fixed the way the env rule reports Makefile values.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.3t0 to 2.11.4:

    Increased the maximum number of args for functions from 100 to 1024.
    Increased calc's internal evaluation stack from 1024 to 2048 args.
    Added test8600.cal to the regression suite to test these new limits.

    Updated and fixed misc typos in calc/README.

    Clarified in the COPYING file that ALL calc source files, both
    LGPL covered and exceptions to the LGPL files may be freely used
    and distributed.

    Added help files or updated for: bernoulli, calc_tty, catalan,
    digit, digits, euler, freeeuler, places and sleep.

    A collection of 18 patches from Ernest Bowen
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>:

    (1)  A new flag -f has been defined which has the effect of a read
    command without the need to terminate the file name with a semicolon
    or newline.  Thus:

	    calc "read alpha; read beta;"

    may be replaced by:

	    calc -f alpha -f beta

    Quotations marks are recognized in a command like

	    calc -f 'alpha beta'

    in which the name of the file to be read includes a space.

    (2) Flags are interpreted even if they are in a string, as in:

	    calc "-q -i define f(x) = x^2;"

    which has the effect of:

	    calc -q -i "define f(x) = x^2;"

    To achieve this, the use of getopts() in calc.c has been dropped in
    favor of direct reading of the arguments produced by the shell.
    In effect, until a "--" or "-s" or a calc command (recognized
    by not starting with '-') is encountered, the quotation signs in
    command lines like the above example are ignored.  Dropping getopts()
    permits calc to specify completely the syntax rules calc will apply
    to whatever it is given by the shell being used.

    (3) For executable script (also called interpreter) files with first
    line starting with "#!", the starting of options with -S has been
    replaced by ending the options with -f.  For example, the first line:

	    #! full_pathname_for_calc -S -q -i

    is to be replaced by:

	    #! full_pathname_for_calc -q -i -f

    Thus, if the pathname is /usr/bin/calc and myfile contains:

	    #!/usr/bin/calc -q -i -f
	    global deg = pi()/180;
	    define Sin(x) = sin(x * deg);

    and has been made executable by:

	    chmod u+x myfile

    myfile would be like a version of calc that ignored any startup
    files and had an already defined global variable deg and a function
    Sin(x) which will return an approximation to the sine of x degrees.
    The invocation of myfile may be followed by other options (since
    the first line in the script has only flagged options) and/or calc
    commands as in:

	    ./myfile -c read alpha '; define f(x) = Sin(x)^2'

    (The quotation marks avoid shell interpretation of the semicolon and
    parentheses.)

    (4) The old -S syntax for executable scripts implied the -s flag so that
    arguments in an invocation like

	    ./myfile alpha beta

    are passed to calc; in this example argv(0) = 'alpha', argv(1) =
    'beta'.  This has been changed in two ways: an explicit -s is required
    in the first line of the script and then the arguments passed in the
    above example are argv(0) = 'myfile', argv(1) = 'alpha', argv(1) = 'beta'.

    In an ordinary command line, "-s" indicates that the shell words
    after the one in which "-s" occurred are to be passed as arguments
    rather than commands or options.  For example:

	    calc "-q -s A = 27;" alpha beta

    invokes calc with the q-flag set, one command "A = 27;", and two arguments.

    (5) Piping to calc may be followed by calc becoming interactive.
    This should occur if there is no -p flag but -i is specified, e.g.:

	    cat beta | calc -i -f alpha

    which will do essentially the same as:

	    calc -i -f alpha -f beta

    (6) The read and help commands have been  changed so that several
    files may be referred to in succession by separating their names
    by whitespace.  For example:

	    ; read alpha beta gamma;

    does essentially the same as:

	    ; read alpha; read beta; read gamma;

    This is convenient for commands like:

	    calc read file?.cal

    when file?.cal expands to something like file1.cal file2.cal file3.cal:

	    myfiles='alpha beta gamma'
	    calc read $myfiles

    or for C-shell users:

	    set myfiles=(alpha beta gamma)
	    calc read $myfiles


    (7) The -once option for read has been extended to -f.  For example,

	    calc -f -once alpha

    will ignore alpha if alpha has been read in the startup files.  In a
    multiple read statement, -once applies only to the next named file.
    For example

	    ; read -once alpha beta -once gamma;

    will read alpha and gamma only if they have not already been read,
    but in any case, will read beta.

    (8) A fault in the programming for the cd command has been corrected
    so that specifying a directory by a string constant will work.  E.g:

	    ; cd "my work"

    should work if the current directory has a directory with name "my work".

    (9) new functions bernoulli(n) and euler(n) have been defined to
    return the Bernoulli number and the Euler number with index n.
    After evaluation for an even positive n, this value and these for
    smaller positive even n are stored in a table from which the values
    can be reread when required.  The memory used for the stored values
    can be freed by calling the function freebernoulli() or freeeuler().

    The function catalan(n) returns the catalan number with index n.
    This is evaluated using essentially comb(2*n, n)/(n+1).

    (10) A function sleep(n) has been defined which for positive n calls
    the system function sleep(n) if n is an integer, usleep(n) for other
    real n.  This suspends operation for n seconds and returns the null
    value except when n is integral and the sleep is interrupted by a
    SIGINT, in which case the remaining number of seconds is returned.

    (11) The effect of config("trace", 8) which displays opcodes of
    functions as they are successfully defined has been restricted to
    functions defined with explicit use of "define".  Thus, it has been
    deactivated for the ephemeral functions used for evaluation of calc
    command lines or eval() functions.

    (12) The functions digit(), digits(), places() have been extended to
    admit an optional additional argument for an integral greater-than-one
    base which defaults to 10.  There is now no builtin limit on the
    size of n in digit(x, n, b), for example, digit(1/7, -1e100) which
    would not work before can now be handled.

    (13) The function, digits(x), which returns the number of decimal
    digits in the integer part of x has been changed so that if abs(x) <
    1, it returns 0 rather than 1.  This also now applies to digits(x,b).

    (14) Some programming in value.c has been improved.  In particular,
    several occurrences of:

	    vres->v_type = v1->v_type;
	    ...
	    if (v1->v_type < 0) {
		    copyvalue(v1, vres);
		    return;
	    }

    have been replaced by code that achieves exactly the same result:

	    vres->v_type = v1->v_type;
	    ...
	    if (v1->v_type < 0)
		    return;

    (15) Some operations and functions involving null-valued arguments
    have been changed so that they return null-value rather than "bad
    argument-type" error-value.  E.g. null() << 2 is now null-valued
    rather than a "bad argument for <<" error-value.

    (16) "global" and "local" may now be used in expressions.  For example:

	    ; for (local i = 0; i < 5; i++) print i^2;

    is now acceptable, as is:

	    ; define f(x = global x) = (global x = x)^2;

    which breaks wise programming rules and would probably better be handled
    by something like:

	    ; global x
	    ; define f(t = x) = (x = t)^2;

    Both definitions produce the same code for f.  For non-null t, f(t)
    returns t^2 and assigns the value of t to x;  f() and f(t) with null t
    return x^2.

    Within expressions, "global" and "local" are to be followed by just one
    identifier.  In "(global a = 2, b)" the comma is a comma-operator; the
    global variable a is created if necessary and assigned the value 2, the
    variable b has to already exist.   The statement "global a = 2, b" is
    a declaration of global variables and creates both a and b if they
    don't already exist.

    (18) In a config object, several components have been changed from
    long to LEN so that they will now be 32 bit integers for machines with
    either 32 or 64-bit longs.  In setting such components, the arguments
    are now to less than 2^31.  Before this change:

	    ; config("mul2", 2^32 + 3)

    would be accepted on a 64-bit machine but result in the same as:

	    ; config("mul2", 3)


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.2t0 to 2.11.2t1.0:

    Fixed a bug whereby help files are not displayed correctly on
    systems such as NetBSD 1.4.1.  Thanks to a fix from Jakob Naumann.

    Changed Email addresses to use asthe.com.  Changed URLs to use
    www.isthe.com.  NOTE: The Email address uses 'asthe' and the web
    site URL uses 'isthe'.

    Using calc-bugs at asthe dot com for calc bug reports,
    calc-contrib at asthe dot com for calc contributions,
    calc-tester-request at asthe dot com for requests to join calc-tester and

    Replaced explicit Email addresses found this file with the <user at
    site dot domain> notation to reduce the potential for those folks
    to be spammed.

    The Makefile attempts to detect the existence of /dev/urandom with -e
    instead of the less portable -c.

    Misc Makefile fixes.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.1t3 to 2.11.1t4:

    Removed non-portable strerror() tests (3715, 3724 and 3728) from
    calc/regress.cal.

    Fixed missing strdup() from func.c problem.

    Fixed a problem that would have come up on a very long #! command line
    if the system permitted it.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.1 to 2.11.1t2.2:

    Placed calc under version 2.1 of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

	The calc commands:

	    help copyright
	    help copying
	    help copying-lgpl

	should display the generic calc copyright as well as the contents
	of the COPYING and COPYING-LGPL files.

	Those files contain information about the calc's GNU Lesser General
	Public License, and in particular the conditions under which you
	are allowed to change it and/or distribute copies of it.

    Removed the lint facility from the Makefile.  Eliminated Makefile
    variables: ${LCFLAGS}, ${LINT}, ${LINTLIB} and ${LINTFLAGS}.
    Removed the lint.sed file.

    Cleaned up help display system.  Help file lines that begin with
    '##' are not displayed.

    Calc source and documentation now uses these terms:

	*.cal files	calc resource file
	*.a files	calc binary link library
	#! files	calc shell script

    Renamed 'help stdlib' to 'help resource'.	The 'help stdlib' is
    aliased to 'help resource' for arg compatibility.

    Renamed config("lib_debug") to config("resource_debug").
    The config("lib_debug") will have the same effect as
    config("resource_debug") for backward compatibility.

    Renamed the source sub-directory lib to cal.  The default $CALCPATH
    now uses ./cal:~/cal (instead of ./lib:~/lib).  Changed LIB_PASSDOWN
    Makefile variable to CAL_PASSDOWN.

    Fixed misc compile warnings and bugs.

    Fixed problem of incorrect paths in the formation of installed
    calc shell scripts.

    Changed the recommended Comqaq cc compile to be -std0 -fast -O4 -static.

    Fixed a problem related to asking for help for a non-existent file.

    Added ./.calcinit to the default calcrc.

    Added cscript/README and help cscript to document the calc shell
    script supplied with calc.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.0t10 to 2.11.0t11:

    Misc code cleanup.	Removed dead code.  Removed trailing whitespace.
    Fixed whitespace to make the best use of 8 character tabs.

    Fixed some bugs relating to '// and %' in combination with some
    of the rounding modes based on a patch from Ernest Bowen
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>.

    A patch from Klaus Alexander Seistrup <klaus at seistrup dot dk>, when
    used in combination with the GNU-readline facility, will prevent
    it from saving empty lines.

    Minor typos fixed in regress.cal

    Added 8500 test series and test8500.cal to perform more extensive
    tests on // and % with various rounding modes.

    The 'unused value ignored' messages now start with Line 999: instead
    of just 999:.

    Fixed the long standing issue first reported by Saber-C in the
    domul() function in zmil.c thanks to a patch by Ernest Bowen
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>.

    Added zero dimensional matrices.  A zero dimensional matrix is defined as:

	mat A[]	  or	A = mat[]

    Updated the help/mat file to reflect the current status of matrices
    including zero dimensional matrices.

    Added indices() builtin function as written by Ernest Bowen <ernie
    at turing dot une dot edu dot au> developed from an idea of Klaus
    Seistrup <klaus at seistrup dot dk>.  See help/indices for details.

    Fixed a number of insure warnings as reported by Michel van der List
    <vanderlistmj at sbphrd dot com>.

    Fixed a number of help file typos discovered by Klaus Alexander
    Seistrup <klaus at seistrup dot .dk>.

    Removed REGRESS_CAL as a Makefile variable.

    Added calcliblist and calcliblistfmt utility Makefile rules to allow
    one to print the list of distribution files that are used (but not
    built) to form either the libcalc.a or the libcustcalc.a library.

    Added a patch from <Randall.Gray at marine dot csiro dot au> to make
    ^D terminate, but *only* if the line it is on is completely empty.
    Removed lib/altbind and removed the CALCBINDINGS Makefile variable.

    A new config("ctrl_d") value controls how the ``delete_char'', which
    by default is bound to ^D (Control D), will or will not exit calc:

	config("ctrl_d", "virgin_eof")

	    If ^D is the only character that has been typed on a line,
	    then calc will exit.  Otherwise ^D will act according to the
	    calc binding, which by default is a Emacs-style delete-char.

	    This is the default mode.

	config("ctrl_d", "never_eof")

	    The ^D never exits calc and only acts according calc binding,
	    which by default is a Emacs-style delete-char.

	    Emacs purists may want to set this in their ~/.calcrc startup file.

	config("ctrl_d", "empty_eof")

	    The ^D always exits calc if typed on an empty line.	 This
	    condition occurs when ^D either the first character typed,
	    or when all other characters on the line have been removed
	    (say by deleting them).

	    Users who always want to exit when ^D is typed at the beginning
	    of a line may want to set this in their ~/.calcrc startup file.

	Note that config("ctrl_d") apples to the character bound to each
	and every ``delete_char''.  So if an alternate binding it setup,
	then those char(s) will have this functionality.

    Updated help/config and help/mode, improved the readability and
    fixed a few typos.	Documented modes, block formats and block bases
    ("mode", "blkfmt" & "blkbase") that were previously left off out of
    the documentation.

    The config("blkbase") and config("blkfmt") values return strings
    instead of returning integers.  One cannot use integers to set
    these values, so returning integers was useless.

    Applied the dangling name fix from Ernest Bowen
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>.

    Show func prints function on order of their indices, and with
    config("lib_debug") & 4 == 4  some more details about the functions
    are displayed.

    Fixed another ``dangling name'' bug for when the object types list
    exceeded 2000.

    Fixed a bug related to opening to a calc session:

	define res_add(a,b) = obj res {r} = {a.r + b.r};
	...
	obj res A = {1,2}. obj res B = {3,4}

    A hash of an object takes into account the object type.  If X and Y
    are different kinds of objects but have the same component values,
    they will probably return different rather than the same values for
    hash(X) and hash(Y).

    Added support for config("ctrl_d") to the GNU-readline interface
    as written by Klaus Alexander Seistrup <klaus at seistrup dot dk>.

	Currently, the config("ctrl_d", "virgin_eof") is not fully
	supported.  Under GNU-readline, it acts the same way as
	config("ctrl_d", "empty_eof").	Emacs users may find this
	objectionable as ``hi^A^D^D^D'' will cause calc to exit due to
	the issuing of one too many ^D's.

	Emacs users may want to put:

	    config("ctrl_d", "never_eof"),;

	into their ~/.calcrc startup files to avoid this problem.

    Made misc documentation fixes.

    Fixed the make depend rule.

    Applied Ernest Bowen's <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>
    complex function power(), exp() and transcendental function patch:

	Calc will return a "too-large argument" error-value for exp(x,
	epsilon) if re(x) >= 2^30 or if an estimate indicates that the
	result will have absolute value greater than 2^2^30 * epsilon.
	Otherwise the evaluation will be attempted but may fail due to
	shortage of memory or may require a long runtime if the result
	will be very large.

	The power(a, b, epsilon) builtin will return a "too-large result"
	if an estimate indicates that the result will have absolute value
	that is > 2^2^30 * epsilon.  Otherwise the evaluation will be
	attempted but may fail due to shortage of memory or may require
	a long runtime if the result will be very large.

	Changes have been made to the algorithms used for some special
	functions sinh(), cosh(), tanh(), sin(), cos(), etc., that make
	use of exp().  In particular  tanh(x)  is now much faster and
	doesn't run out of memory when x is very large - the value to
	be returned is then 1 to a high degree of accuracy.

	When the true value of a transcendental function is 1, as is
	cos(x) for x == 0, calc's version of the function will now return
	1 rather than the nearest multiple of epsilon.	E.g. cos(0, 3/8)
	no longer returns 9/8.

	The restriction of abs(n) < 1000000 on scale(x, n) has been
	removed.  The only condition n now has to satisfy for calc to
	attempt the operation is  n < 2^31, the same as for calc to
	attempt x << n and x^n.

	Changed root(x,n) so that when x is negative and n is odd it
	returns the principal complex n-th root of x rather than -1, e.g.
	root(-1,3) now returns -.5+.8660...i.

	Changed power(a,b) to permit a to be negative when b is real.
	E.g. power(-2,3) will now return 8 rather than cause a "negative
	base" error.

	Fixed several improper free and link problems in the comfunc.c code.

    Removed BOOL_B64 symbol from Makefile.

    The following config values return "true" or "false" strings:

	    tilde  tab	leadzero  fullzero  blkverbose	verbose_quit

	These config values can still be set with same boolean strings
	("on", "off", "true", "false", "t", ...) as well as via the
	numerical values 0 (for "false") and non-0 (for "true"), however.

    Added -s to the calc command line.	The -s flag will cause unused
    args (args after all of the -options on the command line) to remain
    as unevaluated strings.

    If calc is called with -s, then the new function argv() will return
    the number of strings on the command line.	Also argv(n) will return
    the n-th such string or null is no such string exists.

    Calc now handles calc shell scripts.  A calc shell script is an
    executable file that starts with:

	    #!/usr/local/bin/calc -S

	Where ``/usr/local/bin/calc'' is the path to the calc binary.
	Additional -options may be added to the line, but it MUST
	start with -S.	For example, the executable file ``plus''
	contain the following:

	    #!/usr/local/bin/calc -S -e
	    /*
	     * This is a simple calc shell script to add two values
	     */
	    print eval(argv(0)) + eval(argv(1));

	then the following command:

	    ./plus 23 'pi(1e-5)'

	will print:

	    26.14159

    If calc is called with -S as the first arg, then calc will assume that
    it is being called from a #! calc shell script file.  The -S implies
    the -s flag.  If -i is not given, -S also implies -d and -p.

    Fixed the problem with non-literal string type checking for the
    C printf-like functions.  Able to determine if "%ld" or "%lld"
    is appropriate for printing of 64 bit long longs by way of the C
    symbol L64_FORMAT in the longlong.h header file.

    The following lines are treated as comments by calc:

	#! this is a comment
	# this is a comment
	#	this is a comment
	#
	# The lone # above was also a comment
	## is also a comment

    Improved how calc makes changes to file descriptor interactive state.
    Moved state changing code to calc_tty() and orig_tty() in lib_calc.c.
    The libcalc_call_me_last() function will restore all changed descriptor
    states that have not already been restored.

    Added the following read-only config values:

	config("program")	path to calc program or calc shell script
	config("basename")	basename of config("program")
	config("version")	calc version string


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.0t8.9.1 to 2.11.0t9.4.5:

    The config("verbose_quit") will control the printing of the message:

	    Quit or abort executed

	when a non-interactive ABORT, QUIT or EXIT is encountered.  By default,
	config("verbose_quit") is TRUE and the message is printed.  If one does:

	    config("verbose_quit", 0)

	the message is disabled.

    Added 8400 regression test set and test8400.cal to test the new
    quit and config("verbose_quit") functionality.

    Fixed the BigEndian BASEB==16 regression bugs by correctly swapping
    16 bit HALFs in a 64 bit value (such as a 64 bit file pointer).

    Added calclevel() builtin to calculation level at which it is called.

    Added help/calclevel and help/inputlevel help files.

    Removed regression tests 951 and 5984 so that the regress test will
    run in non-interactively / without a TTY such as under Debian's
    build daemon.

    The eval(str) builtin will return an error-value rather than cause
    an execution error str has a scan-error.

    Declarations are permitted to end with EOF as well as a newline or ';'.

    When prompt() occurs while reading a file, it will take input from
    the terminal rather than taking it from a file.  For example:

	    /* This demonstrates the use of prompt() and some other things  */
	    config("verbose_quit", 0);
	    define getnumber() {
		local x;
		for (;;) {
		    x = eval(prompt(">>> "));
		    if (isnum(x))
			return x;
		    print "Not a number! Try again";
		}
	    }
	    print "This will display the sqrt of each number you enter";
	    print "Enter quit to stop";
	    for (;;) {
		print sqrt(getnumber());
	    }
	    print "Good bye";

	Comments entered at input terminal level may be spread over several
	lines.	For example:

	    /*
	     * Assume that this calc script is called: comment.cal
	     * Then these commands now work:
	     *	cat comment.cal | calc
	     *	calc < comment.cal
	     */
	    print "Hello";

    Added:

	-D calc_debug[:lib_debug:[user_debug]]

    to set the initial value of config("calc_debug"), config("lib_debug")
    and config("user_debug").

    The : separated strings of -D are interpreted as signed 32 bit values.
    After an optional leading sign a leading zero indicates octal
    conversion, and a leading ``0x'' or ``0X'' hexadecimal conversion.
    Otherwise, decimal conversion is assumed.

    Reordered the config structure moving calc_debug ahead of lib_debug.

    Added bits 4 and 5 to config("calc_debug"):

	4	Report on changes to the state of stdin as well as changes
		to internal variables that control the setting and restoring
		of stdin.

	5	Report on changes to the run state of calc.

    Fixed portability issue in seed.c relating to /dev/urandom and ustat.

    Added a fix from Martin Buck <mb at netwings dot ch> to detect when
    calc aborts early instead of completing the regression test.
    Now 'make chk' will require the last line of calc output to
    end in the string ``Ending regression tests''.

    Added a patch from Martin Buck <mb at netwings dot ch> to allow use of
    GNU-readline.  Note that GNU-readline is not shipped with calc.
    His patch only provides the hooks to use it.  One must comment out:

	    USE_READLINE=
	    READLINE_LIB=
	    READLINE_INCLUDE=

	and comment in:

	    USE_READLINE= -DUSE_READLINE
	    READLINE_LIB= -lreadline -lhistory
	    READLINE_INCLUDE= -I/usr/include/readline

	in addition to pre-installing GNU-readline in your system to use
	this facility.

    Changed the "object already defined" math_error to a scanerror message.

    Removed the limit on the number of object types.

    Calc tarballs are now named calc-version.tar.gz and untar into
    a sub-directory called calc-version.

    Made a small change to declarations of static variables to reduce
    the internal opcodes needed to declare them.

    Fixed a permission problem on ranlib-ed *.a files that was reported
    by Michael Somos <somos at grail dot cba dot csuohio dot edu>.

    Added patch by Klaus Alexander Seistrup <klaus at seistrup dot dk>
    related to GNU-readline:

	+ enable calc specific bindings in ~/.inputrc
	+ save a copy of your session to disk and reload them next
	  time you're using calc
	+ only add a line to the history if it is different from
	  the previous line

    Added the Makefile symbol HAVE_GETRUSAGE to determine if the
    system supports the getrusage() system call.

    Fixed the make depend code in the custom and sample Makefiles.

    Fixed how the help/builtin file is formed.	The help/Makefile is
    now given the name of the native C compiler by the top level Makefile.

    The include files are installed under INCDIRCALC (a new Makefile variable)
    which by default is ${INCDIR}/calc.	 The INCDIR (also a new Makefile var)
    by default is /usr/local/include.  Include files previously installed
    directly under ${LIBDIR} will be removed.

    Added the piforever() function to lib/pi.cal.  It was written by
    Klaus Alexander Seistrup <klaus at seistrup dot dk> and was inspired by
    an algorithm conceived by Lambert Meertens.	 (See also the ABC
    Programmer's Handbook, by Geurts, Meertens & Pemberton, published
    by Prentice-Hall (UK) Ltd., 1990.)	The piforever() function prints
    digits of pi for as long as your memory and system uptime allows.  :-)

    Fixed the URLs found throughout the source and documentation which did
    not and in /, but should for performance and server load reasons.

    Cleaned up and improved handling of "mat" and "obj".  The comma in:

	    mat A[2], B[3];

	is changed to whatever is appropriate in the context:

	    + comma operator
	    + separator of arguments in a function call
	    + separator of arguments in a definition
	    etc.

	The expression (mat A[2]), B[3] returns B[3], assuming B already
	exists as something created by a statement like: global mat B[4].

	What used to be done by the expression:

	    mat A[2], B[3]

	will now require something like:

	    mat A[2], mat B[3]	or	A = mat[2], B = mat[3]

	For example, if obj point and obj pair are known types, the
	following is now allowed:

	    L = list(mat[2], mat[3], obj point, obj pair)

	As another example, the following is allowed:

	    define f(a = mat[2] = {3,4}) = 5 * a;

	as well as the following:

	    obj point {x,y}, PP = obj pair {A,B} = {obj point, obj point}

	which creates two object types at compile time and when executed,
	assigns a pair-object value to a variable PP.

    Fixed a bug whereby a for loop would behave incorrectly.  For example:

	    config("trace", 2),
	    global x;
	    define f() {for ( ; x > 0; x--) {print x;}}
	    x = 5, f()

	will stop after printing 1 instead of looping forever.

    Added values l_format, which when CHECK_L_FORMAT is defined ahead
    of including longlong.h will help detect when a system can deal with
    'long long' but not '%lld' in printf.  If a system with 'long long'
    uses '%ld' to print a 64 bit value, then l_format will be > 0;
    otherwise if "%lld" is required, l_format will be < 0.

    Added HAVE_STRDUP Makefile variable as well as the have_strdup.c
    program that forms the have_strdup.h file.	The have_strdup.h file
    will define HAVE_STRDUP is the system has strdup().	 If HAVE_STRDUP
    is not defined, then calc will use calc_strdup() to simulate
    the real strdup() function.

    Calc no longer makes use of sys_errlist and sys_nerr.  Some systems
    no longer support these values (even though they should from a
    legacy prospective).  Calc now relies on the fact that strerror()
    will return NULL of no such system error exists.  System errors >=
    10000 will be considered calc errors instead.  The Makefile symbol
    ERRNO_DECL has gone away as well as calc_errno.c and calc_errno.h.

    System errors that are are not known to to the libc strerror()
    function, will now print (via the strerror() calc builtin function)
    something such as:

	    Unknown error 9999

    Fixed some insure code inspection tool issues that were discovered
    and investigated by Michel van der List <vanderlistmj at sbphrd dot com>.

    Made an effort to ensure that the v_subtype of VALUES are initialized
    to V_NOSUBTYPE through out the source code.

    Established a separate calc-bugs address from the calc-tester
    mailing list.  Using anti-spam address forms in order to try and
    stay under the radar of spammers as much as one can do so.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.0t8 to 2.11.0t8.9:

    Moved 'wishlist' enhancements from the help/todo file to a new
    help/wishlist file.	 Ordered, by priority, help/todo items into
    Very High, High and Medium priority items.

    The BUGS file now has a 'bugs' section as well as a 'mis-features'
    section.

    Improved how calc internally dealt with reading EOF or '\0' characters.

    Calc now allows multiple defines to occur on the same line:
    (Thanks goes to Ernest Bowen <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>)

	define f8300(x) = x^2; define g8300(x) = 1 - x;

    Improved calc's ability to deal with and recover from errors.

    Added inputlevel() builtin to return the input processing level.
    In an interact mode, inputlevel() returns 0.  When directly reading
    a calc script, inputlevel() returns 1.  When reading a script which
    in turn reads another script, inputlevel() returns 2.  etc...

    If $CALCRC has more than one file as in file1:file2 and an error
    occurs in file1, then calc -c will not read file2.

    Fixed some of the old Email addresses found in calc documentation.

    Added HAVE_USTAT, HAVE_GETSID, HAVE_GETPGID, HAVE_GETTIME, HAVE_GETPRID
    and HAVE_URANDOM symbols to the Makefile.  These symbols, along with
    have_ustat.c, have_getsid.c, have_getpgid.c, have_gettime.c and
    have_getprid.c form: have_ustat.h, have_getsid.h, have_getpgid.h,
    have_gettime.h, have_getprid.h and have_urandom.h which in turn
    are used by pseudo_seed() in seed.c to determine what types of
    system services can be used to form a pseudo-random seed.

    Fixed the way calc -c will continue processing $CALCRC when errors
    are encountered.  Unless -d is also given, calc -c will report
    when calc is unable to open a $CALCRC file.

    Fixed the lower level make depend rules.

    Misc cleanup on the have_*.c support source files.

    Misc source file cleanup for things such as } else { style consistency.

    Fixed the basis for FNV-1 hashes.  Prior to this fix, the hash()
    builtin produced FNV hash values that did not match the FNV-1
    algorithm as specified in:

	http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/fnv/index.html

    Removed an unused argument in the function getbody() in codegen.c.

    Encountering of EOF in getbody() will cause a scanerror rather then
    stop activity.  This will now result in a scanerror:

	echo 'define f(x) { ' > myfile
	calc -i read myfile

    A '{' at the start of a command and a later matching '}' surrounding zero
    or more statements (and possibly newlines) results in a function body to
    be "evaluated".   This permits another command to follow on the same
    line as the '}' as in:

		{display(5)} read something;
	and:
		{static a = 5} define f(x) = a + x;

    String constants can now be concatenated.  For example:

	s = "curds" ' and ' "whey";

    Added FNV hash to the regression test suite.

    Added Ernest Bowen's <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au> fix for the
    FNV regression test of the hash() builtin function.

    Added Ernest Bowen's <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au> patch to
    improve the way config("calc_debug").  Now the lower 4 bits of the
    config("calc_debug") parameter have the following meaning:

       n	       Meaning of bit n of config("calc_debug")

       0       Outputs shell commands prior to execution.

       1       Outputs currently active functions when a quit instruction
	       is executed.

       2       Some details of shs, shs1 and md5 hash states are included
	       in the output when these are printed.

       3       When a function constructs a block value, tests are
	       made that the result has the properties required for use of
	       that block, e.g. that the pointer to the start of the
	       block is not NULL, and that its "length" is not negative.
	       A failure will result in a runtime error.

    Changed the meaning of (config("calc_debug") & 1) from only printing
    the shell commands (and pausing) while displaying help files into
    the printing of any shell command prior to execution.

    Documented the meaning of config("lib_debug"):

	n		Meaning of bit n of config("lib_debug")

	0	When a function is defined, redefined or undefined at
		interactive level, a message saying what has been done
		is displayed.

	1	When a function is defined, redefined or undefined during
		the reading of a file, a message saying what has been done
		is displayed.

	The value for config("lib_debug") in both oldstd and newstd is
	3, but if calc is invoked with the -d flag, its initial value
	is zero.  Thus, if calc is started without the -d flag, until
	config("lib_debug") is changed, a message will be output when a
	function is defined either interactively or during the reading
	of a file.

    Changed the calc lib files to reflect the new config("lib_debug")
    bit field meaning.	Calc lib files that need to print extra information
    should now do something such as:

	if (config("lib_debug") & 3) {
		print "obj xyz defined";
		print "funcA([val1 [, val2]]) defined";
		print "funcB(size, mass, ...) defined";
	}

    Fixed the help/custom_cal, help/new_custom, and help/copy files so
    that they contain the correct contents instead of the 'usage' file.

    Fixed problem with loss of bindings when calc -i args runs into
    an error while processing 'args' and drops into interactive mode
    without the terminal bindings being set.

    Added patch from Ernest Bowen to establish the abort command as
    well as to clarify the roles of quit and exit.  See the help/command
    file for details.

    Updated to some extend, the help/statement and help/command help
    files with new information about SHOW, QUIT, EXIT and ABORT.

    Added show sizes to pzasusb8.cal.

    Updated calc man page and help/usage file to reflect recent
    command line changes.

    Fixed a bug, reported by Michael Somos <somos at grail dot cba dot
    csuohio dot edu>, which prevented calc -m from being used.

    Fixed misc compiler warnings.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.0t7 to 2.11.0t7.5:

    Calc has some new command line flags / command line meaning:
    (Thanks goes to Ernest Bowen <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>)

	-i	Go into interactive mode if possible.

	-c	Continue reading command lines even after an execution
		error has caused the abandonment of a line

	To understand the -i and -c effects, consider the following
	file (call it myfile.cal) which has deliberate errors in it:

	    print 1;
	    mat A[1] = {2,3};
	    print 2;
	    epsilon(-1);
	    print 3;

	calc read myfile

	    Reports an error on the 2nd line and exits; prints 1 only.

	calc -c read myfile

	    Report errors on the 2nd and 4th lines and exits; prints 1,2 and 3.

	calc -i read myfile

	    Report errors on the 2nd and gives you a prompt; prints 1 only.

	calc -i -c read myfile

	    Report errors on the 2nd and 4th and gives you a prompt;
	    prints 1, 2 and 3.

	cat myfile | calc

	    Reports an error on the 2nd line and exits; prints 1 only.

	cat myfile | calc -c

	    Report errors on the 2nd and 4th lines and exits; prints 1,2 and 3.

	Note that continuation refers to command lines, not to statements.  So:

	    calc -c 'print "start"; mat A[1] = {2,3}; print "end";'

	since it contains no newline, the whole string is compiled,
	but execution is abandoned when the error is encountered and
	the string ``end'' is not printed.

	You can use your shell to supply newlines in your command line
	arguments.  For example in sh, ksh, bash:

	    calc -c 'print "start";
	    mat A[1] = {2,3};
	    print "end";'

	will print both ``start'' and ``end''.	C-shell users can do:

	    calc -c 'print "start"; \
	    mat A[1] = {2,3}; \
	    print "end";'

	however sh, ksh, bash will not see ``end'' printed because their
	shell will remove the internal newlines.

    Added display(n) builtin which does almost the same as config("display",n)
    except that rather than causing an execution with an out-of-range or
    bad-type argument type, it simply writes a message to stderr.  This
    also now happens to the errmax() builtin.

    Added qtime.cal to the standard calc library.

    Added another command line flag to calc:

	-d	Disable display of the opening title and config("lib_debug",0)

	The command:

	    calc 'read qtime; qtime(2)'

	will output something like:

	    qtime(utc_hr_offset) defined
	    It's nearly ten past six.

	whereas:

	    calc -d 'read qtime; qtime(2)'

	will just say:

	    It's nearly ten past six.

    A call of errmax(-1) will prevent errcount from aborting calc.

    Add the function stoponerror(n) which, as the name implies, controls
    if calc stop on an error based on the value of n:

	n > 0	stop on error even if -c was given on the command line
	n == 0	if -c, continue, without -c, stop
	n < 0	continue on error, even if -c was given on the command line

    Calc compilation now stops at the first scanerror.

    Restored the feature where -p disables the printing of leading tabs
    as of config("tab",0) had been executed.  So using calc in a pipe:

	calc -p 2+17 | whey

    will write '19' instead of '\t19' to the whey command.

    Updated calc man page and help/usage file to reflect recent
    command line changes.

    Converted start_done into a general calc run state enum called
    run_state within the calc source.

    Removed README.OLD.

    Added the Makefile variable ${LCC} to invoke the local c compiler.
    By default, ${CC} also run the ${LCC} compiler.  The distinction is
    useful when using something such as purify.	 In the case of ${LCC},
    only the local C compiler is invoked.  In the case of ${CC} a purify
    compile is invoked.	 Only the source that must be compiled and run
    on the local machine use ${LCC}; everything else uses ${CC}.

    Fixed memory buffer related problem in eatstring() in token.c.

    Fixed memory leaks related to putenv().

    Fixed memory leaks related to srandom().

    Fixed compilation warnings and problems on BSDI.

    Removed ${CCMAIN} as a variable from the Makefile.	Now files
    use either ${CFLAGS} for general C source and ${ICFLAGS} for
    intermediate C source (e.g., special code for building hsrc files).

    The main calc URL is now:

	http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/calc/

    Misc calc man page fixes.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.11.0t1 to 2.11.0t6.3:

    Removed the makefile symbol MAIN.  Now forcing all functions to correctly
    be declared main.  To satisfy some old broken compilers, a return 0;
    (instead of an exit(0);) is used at the end of main().

    A few of files that were added to calc used 4 character indentation
    whereas most of calc uses 8 character indentation.	These imported
    sources have been changed to conform better with the calc style.

    Added the program calc_errno.c and the Makefile symbol ERRNO_DECL.
    If ERRNO_DECL is empty, calc_errno.c will try various ways to
    declare errno, sys_errlist and sys_nerr.  On success or when
    it gives up, calc_errno will output the middle of the calc_errno.h
    header file.  If ERRNO_DECL is  -DERRNO_NO_DECL, or -DERRNO_STD_DECL
    or -DERRNO_OLD_DECL then the Makefile will build the middle
    of the calc_errno.h header file without calc_errno.c's help.

    The func.c file now includes the constructed header file calc_errno.h
    to ensure that errno, sys_errlist and sys_nerr are declared correctly.

    Changed check.awk to be more 'old awk' friendly.

    Made some of the source a little more ++ friendly.	We are NOT
    porting calc to C++!  We will NOT support C++ compilation of calc.
    Calc will written ANSI C.  We just compiled with a suggestion from
    Love-Jensen, John <jlove-jensen at globalmt dot com> to make calc's version
    of C a little more to C++ compilers.  We are simply avoiding symbols
    such as new or try for example.

    Renamed README to README.OLD.  Renamed README.FIRST to README.
    Updated README, lib/README and BUGS to reflect new URLs and addresses.

    Added a HOWTO.INSTALL file.

    Reordered cc Makefile variable sets in the main Makefile.

    Fixed a bug in hnrmod() and applied a fix that was reported by Ernest
    Bowen <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>.  Added regression tests
    1103 to 1112 to confirm the fix.

    Fixed a bug in version.c related to MINOR_PATCHs in both the
    empty and non-empty MINOR_PATCH cases.

    Fixed malloc and bad storage issues reported by Michel van der List
    <vanderlistmj at sbphrd dot com>.

    Fixed some problems related to path processing while opening files.
    Under extreme cases, an excessively long filename or CALCPATH value
    could create problems.  Placed guards in opensearchfile() function
    in input.c to catch these cases.

    Fixed cases were malloc failures were silently ignored in input.c.

    Eliminated the PATHSIZE limit and the PATHSIZE symbol.

    Added MAX_CALCRC to limit the length of the $CALCRC environment
    variable to 1024 chars.

    Fixed the magic number relating to the initial number of constants
    declared by initconstants().  It is now related to the length
    of the initnumbs[] NUMBER array.

    Added a 'Dec Alpha / Compaq Tru64 cc (non-gnu) compiler set'
    section to the main Makefile.

    Fixed a string handling bug discovered by Dr.D.J.Picton
    <dave at aps5 dot ph dot bham dot ac dot uk> in the custom demo code.

    Fixed a bug in the hnrmod() builtin that was discovered by
    Ernest Bowen <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>.

    Added FORCE_STDC symbol.  When defined it will force __STDC__ like
    conditions.	 Thus for compilers with as the Solaris cc compiler
    that are ANSI-like but still define __STDC__ as 0, one can use
    -DFORCE_STDC and make use of ANSI-like features.

    Removed the CCSHS symbol from the Makefile.	 The shs.c and shs1.c
    files are now compiled with full ${CFLAGS}.

    The custom.c file is now compiled with full ${CFLAGS}.

    Rewrote command line / argument processing code.  Calc is now
    using getopt(3) argument processing.

    Fixed a memory leak related to converting strings to numbers
    in the str2q() function in qio.c.

    Fixed a problem with reading uninitialized memory in the
    v_subtype of a VALUE in the copyvalue() function in value.c.

    Fixed problems in func.c where temporary VALUEs were not
    having their v_type elements initialized.

    Fixed a memory leak in qpi() in qtrans.c.

    Fixed a memory leak in math_getdivertedio() in zio.c.

    Fixed a problem with points going beyond the end of allocated
    memory in addstring() in string.c.

    Fixed a memory leak in zgcdrem(), f_putenv(), zlog() and
    zlog10() in zfunc.c.

    Fixed a memory leak in zdiv() and zshift() in zmath.c.

    Fixed memory leaks in zsrand() in zrand.c.

    Fixed a memory leak in zsrandom1() in zrandom.c.  Fixed memory
    leaks associated with replacing the internal random state with
    another random state.

    Added seed() builtin to return a 64 bit seed for a
    pseudo-random generator.

    Added functionality from Ernest Bowen <ernie at turing dot une dot
    edu dot au> to permit nested "= {...}" assignments for lists as well
    as matrices and objects.  Now one can have a list, matrix or object,
    some of whose elements are lists, matrices or objects, to any depth
    of recursion, and assign values to any number of particular elements
    by an appropriate "initialization" expression.  For example:

	A = mat[2] = {list(1,2), list(3,4,list(5,6))};

    and then assign values to the 6 number elements by:

	A = {{7,8}, {9,10,{11,12}}};

    Closed files that were previously left open from test4600.cal
    as executed by regress.cal and from opening /dev/null by
    regress.cal itself.

    Fixed memory leaks from f_strprintf() and f_putenv() in func.c.

    The regress.cal test suite calls freeredc(), freestatics() and
    freeglobals() at the end of the test suite to free storage
    consumed during the regression.

    Added custom function custom("pzasusb8", n) and lib/pzasusb8.cal based on
    Ernest Bowen's diagnostic patch.

    Thanks to the efforts of Ernest Bowen <ernie at turing dot une dot
    edu dot au> and Dr.D.J.Picton <dave at aps5 dot ph dot bham dot ac
    dot uk>, a nasty endian-ness bug in the sha and sha1 hash functions
    that showed up on machines such as the Sparc was fixed.

    Added functionality from Ernest Bowen <ernie at turing dot une
    dot edu dot au> to give arguments as well as function names after
    definitions when config("lib_debug") >= 0.

    Removed if (config("lib_debug") >= 0) { ... } the ends of most
    of the calc library scripts because it was redundant with the
    new config("lib_debug") >= 0 functionality.	 Some of the calc
    library still has a partial section because some useful
    additional information was being printed:

	chrem.cal	deg.cal	     lucas_tbl.cal   randrun.cal
	mfactor.cal	mod.cal	     poly.cal	     seedrandom.cal
	surd.cal	varargs.cal

    Fixed ellip.cal so that its defined function does not conflict with
    the factor() builtin function.

    Fixed mod.cal so that a defined function does not conflict with
    the mod() builtin function.

    The regression test suite now reads in most calc libs.  A few
    libs are not read because they, by design, produce output
    when read even when config("lib_debug") is set to -1.

    Increased the maximum number of object types that one can define
    from 10 to 128.

    Added a patch from Ernest Bowen <ernie at turing dot une dot edu
    dot au> to correctly hash a V_STR value-type that has an \0 byte
    inside it.

    A patch from Ernest Bowen <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au> now
    defines special meaning to the first 2 bits of config("lib_debug"):

	bit 0 set => messages printed when input is from a terminal
	bit 1 set => messages printed when reading from a file

    The lib/regress.cal regression suite does:

	config("lib_debug", -4);

    to eliminate lib messages (both bit 0 and bit 1 are not set).

    Fixed misc compile warnings and notices.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.10.3t5.38 to 2.11.0t0:

    Fixed a few compile problems found under Red Hat 6.0 Linux.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.10.3t5.38 to 2.11.3t5.46:

    Fixed a bug discovered by Ernest Bowen related to matrix-to-matrix copies.

    Bitwise operations on integers have been extended so that negative
    integers are treated in the same way as the integer types in C.

    Some changes have been made to lib/regress.cal and lib/natnumset.cal.

    Removed V_STRLITERAL and V_STRALLOC string type constants and
    renumbered the V_protection types.

    Added popcnt(x, bitval) builtin which counts the number of
    bits in x that match bitval.

    Misc compiler warning fixes.

    Fixed improper use of putchar() and printf() when printing rationals
    (inside qio.c).

    Fixed previously reported bug in popcnt() in relation to . values.

    Calc man page changes per suggestion from Martin Buck
    <Martin-2.Buck at student dot uni-ulm dot de>.  The calc man page is
    edited with a few more parameters from the Makefile.

    Misc Makefile changes per Martin Buck <Martin-2.Buck at student dot
    uni-ulm dot de>.

    Removed trailing blanks from files.

    Consolidated in the Makefile, where the debug and check rules are found.
    Fixed the regress.cal dependency list.

    Make chk and check will exit with an error if check.awk detects
    a problem in the regression output.	 (Martin Buck)

    Fixed print line for test #4404.

    Moved custom.c and custom.h to the upper level to fix unresolved symbols.

    Moved help function processing into help.c.

    Moved nearly everything into libcalc.a to allow programs access to
    higher level calc objects (e.g., list, assoc, matrix, block, ...).

    Renamed PATCH_LEVEL to MAJOR_PATCH and SUB_PATCH_LEVEL to MINOR_PATCH.
    Added integers calc_major_ver, calc_minor_ver, calc_major_patch
    and string calc_minor_patch to libcalc.a.  Added CALC_TITLE to hold
    the "C-style arbitrary precision calculator" string.

    The function version(), now returns a malloced version string
    without the title.

    Consolidated multiple SGI IRIX -n32 sections (for r4k, r5k and r10k)
    into a single section.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.10.3t5.34 to 2.10.3t5.37:

    Per request from David I Bell, the README line:

      I am allowing this calculator to be freely distributed for personal uses

    to:

      I am allowing this calculator to be freely distributed for your enjoyment

    Added help files for:

	address agd arrow dereference free freeglobals freeredc freestatics
	gd isptr mattrace oldvalue saveval & * -> and .

    Fixed blkcpy() and copy() arg order and processing.	 Now:

	A = blk() = {1,2,3,4}
	B = blk()
	blkcpy(B,A)
	blkcpy(B,A)

    will result in B being twice as long as A.

    Since "make chk" pipes the regression output to awk, we cannot
    assume that stdout and stderr are ttys.  Tests #5985 and #5986
    have been removed for this reason.	(thanks to Martin Buck
    <Martin-2.Buck at student dot uni-ulm dot de> for this report)

    Fixed the order of prints in regress.cal.  By convention, a print
    of a test line happens after the test.  This is because function
    parsed messages occur after the function is parsed.	 Also the
    boolean test will verify before any print statements.  Therefore
    a non-test line is tested and printed as follows:

	y = sha();
	print '7125: y = sha()';

    The perm(a,b) and comb(a,b) have been extended to arbitrary real a and
    integer b.

    Fixed a bug in minv().

    Moved string.c into libcalc.a.

    The NUMBER union was converted back into a flat structure.	Changes
    where 'num' and 'next' symbols were changed to avoid #define conflicts
    were reverse since the #define's needed to support the union went away.

    Removed trailing blanks from files.

    Ernest Bowen <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au> sent in the
    following patch which is described in the next 34 points:

    (0) In the past:

		    A = B = strcat("abc", "def");

	would store "abc" and "def" as literal strings never to be freed, and
	store "abcdef" once each for both A and	 B.  Now the "abc" and "bcd"
	are freed immediately after they are concatenated and "abcdef" is stored
	only once, just as the number 47 would be stored only once for

		    A = B = 47;

	The new STRING structure that achieves this stores not only the
	address of the first character in the string, but also the "length"
	with which the string was created, the current "links" count, and
	when links == 0 (which indicates the string has been freed) the
	address of the next freed STRING.  Except for the null string "",
	all string values are "allocated"; the concept of literal string
	remains for names of variables, object types and elements, etc.

    (1) strings may now include '\0', as in A = "abc\0def".  In normal printing
	this prints as "abc" and strlen(A) returns 3, but its "real" length
	of 7 is given by size(A). (As before there is an 8th zero character
	and sizeof(A) returns 8.)

    (2) If A is an lvalue whose current value is a string of size n, then
	for 0 <= i < n, A[i] returns the character with index i as an addressed
	octet using the same structure as for blocks, i.e. there is no
	distinction between a string-octet and a block-octet.  The same
	operations and functions can be used for both, and as before, an octet
	is in some respects a number in [0,256) and in others a one-character
	string.	 For example, for A = "abc\0def" one will have both A[0] == "a"
	and A[0] == 97.	 Assignments to octets can be used to change
	characters in the string, e.g. A[0] = "A", A[1] = 0, A[2] -= 32,
	A[3] = " " will change the above A to "A\0C def".

    (3) "show strings" now displays the indices, links, length, and some or all
	of the early and late characters in all unfreed strings which are values
	of lvalues or occur as "constants" in function definitions,
	using "\n", "\t", "\0", "\252", etc. when appropriate.	For example,
	the string A in (1) would be displayed as in the definition there.
	Only one line is used for each string.	I've also changed the
	analogous "show numbers" so that only some digits of numbers that
	would require more than one line are displayed.

    (4) "show literals" is analogous to "show constants" for number "constants"
	in that it displays only the strings that have been introduced by
	literal strings as in A = "abc".  There is a major difference between
	strings and numbers in that there are operations by which characters
	in any string may be changed.  For example, after A = "abc",
	A[0] = "X" changes A to "Xbc".	It follows that if a literal string
	is to be constant in the sense of never changing, such a character-
	changing operation should never be applied to that string.

	In this connection, it should be noted that if B is string-valued, then

			    A = B

	results in A referring to exactly the same string as B rather than to
	a copy of what is in B.	 This is like the use of character-pointers in
	C, as in

			    char *s1, *s2;
			    s1 = "abc";
			    s2 = s1;

	To achieve the effect of

			    s2 = (char *) malloc(4);
			    strcpy(s2, s1);

	I have extended the str() function to accept a string as argument.  Then

			    A = str(B);

	will create a new string at a different location from that of B but
	with the same length and characters.  One will then have A == B,
	*A == *B, but &*A != &*B, &A[0] != &B[0].

	To assist in analyzing this sort of thing, I have defined a links()
	function which for number or string valued argument returns the number
	of links to the occurrence of that argument that is being referred to.
	For example, supposing "abc" has not been used earlier:

			    ; A = "abc"
			    ; links(A)
				    2
			    ; links(A)
				    1

	The two links in the first call are to A and the current "oldvalue";
	in the second call, the only link is to A, the oldvalue now being 2.


    (5) strcat(S1, S2, ...) works as before; contribution of a string stops when
	'\0' is encountered.  E.g.

		    strcat("abc\0def", "ghi")

	will return "abcghi".

    (6) For concatenation of full strings I have chosen to follow
	some other languages (like Java, but not Mathematica which uses "<>")
	and use "+" so that, e.g.

		    "abc\0def" + "ghi"

	returns the string "abc\0defghi".  This immediately gives obvious
	meanings to multiplication by positive integers as in

		    2 * "abc" = "abc" + "abc" = "abcabc",

	to negation to reverse as string as in

		    - "abc" = "cba",

	to multiplication by fractions as in

		    0.5 * "abcd" = "ab",

	(where the length is int(0.5 * size("abcd")), and finally, by combining
	these to

		     k * A    and      A * k

	for any real number k and any string A.	  In the case of k == 1, these
	return a new string rather than A itself.  (This differs from
	"" + A and A + "" which return A.)

    (7) char(x) has been changed so that it will accept any integer x or octet
	as argument and return a string of size one with character value
	x % 256.  In the past calc has required 0 <= x < 256; now negative
	x is acceptable; for example, 1000 * char(-1) will now produce the
	same as 1000 * "\377" or 1000 * "\xff".

    (8) For a string s, test(s) now returns zero not only for the null string
	"" but also for a string all of whose characters are '\0'.

    (9) Similarly <, <=, etc. now compare all characters including occurrences
	of '\0' until a difference is encountered or the end of a string is
	reached.  If no difference is encountered but one string is longer than
	the other, the longer string is considered as greater even if the
	remaining characters are all '\0'.

    (10) To retain the C sense of comparison of null-terminated strings I have
	 defined strcmp(S1, S2), and then, for completeness, strncmp(S1, S2, n).
	 For similar reasons, strcpy(S1, S2) and strncpy(S1, S2, n) have been
	 defined.

    (11) For strings, I have defined | and & as bitwise "or" and "and"
	 functions, with S1 | S2 having the size of the larger of S1 and S2,
	 S1 & S2 having the size of the smaller of S1 and S2.  By using, say,
	 4-character strings, one can simulate a C integral type so far as the
	 | and & operations are concerned.   It then seemed appropriate to
	 use the operator ~ for a "bitwise complement" as in C.	 Thus I have
	 defined ~s for a string s to be the string of the same size as s
	 with each character being complemented by the C ~ operation.

    (12) For boolean algebra work on strings it is convenient also to have
	 the bitwise xor and setminus binary operations.  Using C's '^' for xor
	 would be confusing when this is used elsewhere for powers, so I
	 decided to use ~.  For setminus, I adopted the commonly used '\'.
	 Strings of fixed size n can now be used for a boolean algebra
	 structure with 8 * n elements.	 The zero element is n * char(0),
	 the unity is n * char(-1), and one have all of the usual laws like
	 A & (B | C) == A & B | A * C,	A \ B = A & ~B, etc.

    (13) Having extended the bitwise operations for strings, it was appropriate
	 to do the same for integers.  Definitions of the binary ~ and \
	 operations for non-negative integers are straightforward.  For
	 the unary ~ operation, I decided to do what C does with integer
	 types, and defined ~N to be -N - 1.  With the appropriate extensions of
	 |, &, \ and the binary ~, one gets in effect the boolean algebra of
	 finite sets of natural numbers and their complements, by identifying
	 the set with distinct integer elements i_1, i_2, ... with the integer

		    2^i_1 + 2^i_2 + ...

	 For ~N for non-integer real N, I have simply used -N.	There is some
	 logic in this and it is certainly better than an error value.
	 I have not defined the binary operations |, &, ~, \ for non-integral
	 arguments.

	 The use of ~N in this way conflicts with calc's method of displaying
	 a number when it has to be rounded to config("display") decimals.
	 To resolve this, my preference would be to replace the printing of
	 "~" as a prefix by a trailing ellipsis "...", the rounding always
	 being towards zero.  E.g. with config("display", 5), 1/7 would print
	 as ".14285..." rather than "~.14285".	 The config("outround")
	 parameter would determine the type of rounding only for the
	 equivalent of config("tilde", 0).

    (14) For objects, users may create their own definitions for binary |,
	 &, ~ and \ with xx_or, xx_and, xx_xor, xx_setminus functions.
	 For unary ~ and \ operations, I have used the names xx_comp and
	 xx_backslash.

    (15) For the obviously useful feature corresponding to cardinality of a
	 set, I have defined #S for a string S to be the number of nonzero bits
	 in S.	 For a degree of consistency, it was then appropriate to
	 define #N for a nonnegative integer N to be the number of nonzero bits
	 in the binary representation of N.  I've extended this to arbitrary
	 real N by using in effect #(abs(num(N))).  I feel it is better to make
	 this available to users rather than having #N invoke an error message
	 or return an error value.  For defining #X for an xx-object X, I
	 have used the name xx_content to suggest that it is appropriate for
	 something which has the sense of a content (like number of members of,
	 area, etc.).

    (16) Having recognized # as a token, it seemed appropriate to permit its
	 use for a binary operation.  For real numbers x and y I have defined
	 x # y to be abs(x - y).  (This is often symbolized by x ~ y, but it
	 would be confusing to have x ~ y meaning xor(x,y) for strings and
	 abs(x-y) for numbers.)	 Because '#' is commonly called the hash symbol,
	 I have used xx_hashop to permit definition of x # y for xx-objects.

    (17) For a similar reason I've added one line of code to codegen.c so that
	 /A returns the inverse of A.

    (18) Also for a list L, +L now returns the sum of the elements of L.  For
	 an xx object A, +A requires and uses the definition of xx_plus.

    (19) I have given the unary operators ~, #, /, \, and except at the
	 beginning of an expression + and -, the same precedence with
	 right-to-left associativity.  This precedence is now weaker than
	 unary * and &, but stronger than binary & and the shift and power
	 operators.  One difference from before is that now

			    a ^ - b ^ c

	 evaluates as a ^ (- (b ^ c)) rather than a ^ ((- b) ^ c).


    (20) For octets o1, o2, I've defined o1 | o2, o1 & o2, o1 ~ o2, ~o1 so
	 that they return 1-character strings.	#o for an octet o returns the
	 number of nonzero bits in o.

    (21) For substrings I've left substr() essentially as before, but
	 for consistency with the normal block/matrix indexing, I've extended
	 the segment function to accept a string as first argument.  Then

		    segment(A, m, n)

	 returns essentially the string formed from the character with index m
	 to the character with index n, ignoring indices < 0 and indices >=
	 len(A); thus, if m and n are both in [0, size(A))
	 the string is of length abs(m - n) + 1, the order of the characters
	 being reversed if n < m.  Here the indices for a list of size len are
	 0, 1, ..., len - 1.  As it makes some sense, if 0 <= n < size(A),

		    segment(A, n)

	 now returns the one-character string with its character being that with
	 index n in A.	(I've made a corresponding modification to the segment
	 function for lists.)  Some examples, if A = "abcdef",

		    segment(A,2,4) = "cde",

		    segment(A,4,2) = "edc",

		    segment(A,3) = "d",

		    segment(A, -2, 8) = "abcdef",

		    segment(A,7,8) = "".

    (22) As essentially particular cases of segment(), I've defined
	 head(A, n) and tail(A, n) to be the strings formed by the first
	 or last abs(n) characters of A, the strings being4]5O~? reversed '
	 if n is negative.   I've changed the definitions of head and tail for
	 lists to be consistent with this interpretation of negative n.

    (23) Similarly I've left strpos essentially as at present, but search
	 and rsearch have been extended to strings.  For example,

		    search(A, B, m, n)

	 returns the index i of the first occurrence of the string B in A
	 if m <= i < n, or the null value if there is no such occurrence.
	 As for other uses of search, negative m is interpreted as
	 size(A) + m, negative n as size(A) + n.  For a match in this
	 search, all size(B) characters, including occurrences of '\0',
	 in B must match successive characters in A.

	 The function rsearch() behaves similarly but searches in reverse order
	 of the indices.

    (24) A string A of length N determines in obvious ways arrays of M = 8 * N
	 bits.	If the characters in increasing index order are c_0, c_1, ...
	 and the bits in increasing order in c_i are b_j, b_j+1, ..., b_j+7
	 where j = 8 * i, I've taken the array of bits determined by A to be

		    b_0, b_1, ..., b_M-1

	 For example, since "a" = char(97) and 97 = 0b01100001, and
	 "b" = char(98) = 0b01100010, the string "ab" determines the 16-bit
	 array

		    1000011001000110

	 in which the bits in the binary representations of "a" and "b" have
	 been reversed.

	 bit with index n in this array.   This is consistent with the use of
	 bit for a number ch in [0,256), i.e. bit(char(ch), n) = bit(ch, n).
	 For n < 0 or n >= size(A), bit(A,n) returns the null value.

    (25) For assigning values to specified bits in a string, I've defined
	 setbit(A, n) and setbit(A, n, v).  The first assigns the value 1 to
	 bit(A, n), the second assigns test(v) to bit(A, n).

    (26) For consistency with the corresponding number operations, the shift
	 operations A << n and A >> n have been defined to give what look
	 like right- and left-shifts, respectively.  For example, "ab" << 2
	 returns the 16-bit array

		    0010000110010001

	 in which the array for "ab" has been moved 2 bits to the right.

    (27) To achieve much the same as the C strcpy and strncpy functions for
	 null-terminated strings, strcpy(S1, S2) and strncpy(S1, S2, n) have
	 been defined.	Unlike the blkcpy() and copy() functions, the copying
	 for these is only from the beginning of the strings.  Also, unlike C,
	 no memory overflow can occur as the copying ceases when size(S1) is
	 reached.  Note that these overwrite the content of S1 (which affects
	 all strings linked to it) as well as returning S1.  Examples:

	    S = strcpy(6 * "x", "abc")	    <=>	 S = "abc\0xx"

	    S = strcpy(3 * "x", "abcdef")   <=>	 S = "abc"

	    S = strncpy(6 * "x", "abcd", 2) <=>	 S = "ab\0xxx"

	    S = strncpy(6 * "x", "ab", 4)   <=>	 S = "ab\0\0xx"

	    S = strncpy(6 * "x", "ab", 20)  <=>	 S = "ab\0\0\0\0"

	 If a new string S not linked to S1 is to be created, this can be
	 achieved by using str(S1) in place of S1.  For example, the strcpy in

	    A = "xxxxxx"
	    S = strcpy(str("xxxxxx"), "abc")

	 would not change the value of A.

    (28) I've extended the definitions of copy(A, B, ssi, num, dsi) and
	 blkcpy(B, A, num, ssi, dsi) to allow for string-to-string copying
	 and block-to-string copying, but num is now an upper bound for the
	 number of characters to be copied - copying will cease before num
	 characters are copied if the end of the data in the source A or the
	 end of the destination B is reached.  As with other character-changing
	 operations, copying to a string B will not change the locations of
	 B[0], B[1], ... or the size of B.

	 In the case of copying a string to itself, characters are copied in
	 order of increasing index, which is different from block-to-block
	 copying where a memmove is used.  This affects only copy from a
	 string to itself.  For example,

		    A = "abcdefg";
		    copy(A, A, , , 2);

	 will result in A == "abababa".	 If the overwriting that occurs here
	 is not wanted, one may use

		    A = "abcdefg";
		    copy(str(A), A, , , 2);

	  which results in A == "ababcde".

    (29) perm(a,b) and comb(a,b) have been extended to accept any real a and
	 any integer b except for perm(a, b) with integer a such that b <= a < 0
	 which gives a "division by zero" error.  For positive b, both functions
	 are polynomials in a of degree b;  for negative b, perm(a,b) is a
	 rational function (1/((a + 1) * (a+2) ...) with abs(b) factors in the
	 denominator), and comb(a,b) = 0.  (An obvious "todo" is to extend this
	 to complex or other types of a.)

    (30) Although it is not illegal, it seems pointless to use a comma operator
	 with a constant or simple variable as in

		    ; 2 * 3,14159
			    14159
		    ; a = 4; b = 5;
		    ; A = (a , b + 2);
		    ; A
			    7

	 I have added a few lines to addop.c so that when this occurs a
	 "unused value ignored" message and the relevant line number are
	 displayed.  I have found this useful as I occasionally type ','
	 when I mean '.'.

	 There may be one or two other changes resulting from the way I have
	 rewritten the optimization code in addop.c.  I think there was a bug
	 that assumed that PTR_SIZE would be the same as sizeof(long).	By
	 the way, the new OP_STRING is now of index rather than pointer type.
	 It follows that pointers are now used in opcodes only for global
	 variables.  By introducing a table of addresses of global variables
	 like those used for "constants" and "literal strings", the use of
	 pointers in opcodes could be eliminated.

    (31) When calc has executed a quit (or exit) statement in a function or
	 eval evaluation, it has invoked a call to math_error() which causes
	 a long jump to an initial state without freeing any data on the
	 stack, etc.  Maybe more detail should be added to math_error(), but
	 to achieve the freeing of memory for a quit statement and at the same
	 time give more information about its occurrence I have changed the
	 way opcodes.c handles OP_QUIT.	 Now it should free the local variables
	 and whatever is on the stack, and display the name and line-number,
	 for each of the functions currently being evaluated.  The last
	 function listed should be the "top-level" one with name "*".
	 Strings being eval-ed will have name "**".

	 Here is a demo:

	    ; global a;
	    ;
	    ; define f(x) {local i = x^2; a++;
	    ;; if (x > 5) quit "Too large!"; return i;}
	    f() defined
	    ; define g(x) = f(x) + f(2*x);
	    g() defined
	    ; g(2)
		    20
	    ; g(3)
	    Too large!
		    "f": line 3
		    "g": line 0
		    "*": line 6
	    ; eval("g(3)")
	    Too large!
		    "f": line 3
		    "g": line 0
		    "**": line 1
		    "*": line 7
	    ; a
		    6

    (32) I've made several small changes like removing

		    if (vp->v_type == V_NUM) {
			    q = qinv(vp->v_num);
			    if (stack->v_type == V_NUM)
				    qfree(stack->v_num);
			    stack->v_num = q;
			    stack->v_type = V_NUM;
			    return;
		    }

	 from the definition of o_invert.  Presumably these lines were intended
	 to speed up execution for the common case of numerical argument.
	 Comparing the runtimes with and without these lines for inverting
	 thousands of large random numbers in a matrix suggest that execution
	 for real numbers is slightly faster without these lines.

	 Maybe this and other similar treatment of "special cases" should be
	 looked at more closely.

    (33) The new lib script lib/natnumset.cal demonstrates how the new
	 string operators and functions may be used for defining and
	 working with sets of natural numbers not exceeding a
	 user-specified bound.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.10.3t5.28 to 2.10.3t5.33:

    Added hnrmod(v, h, n, r) builtin to compute:

	v % (h * 2^n + r), h>0, n>0, r = -1, 0 or 1

    Changed lucas.cal and mersenne.cal to make use of hnrmod().

    A number of changes from Ernest Bowen:

	(1) introduction of unary & and * analogous to those in C;

	    For an lvalue var, &var returns what I call a
	    value-pointer; this is a constant which may be assigned to
	    a variable as in p = &var, and then *p in expressions has
	    the same effect as var.  Here is a simple example of their use:

		; define s(L) {local v=0; while (size(L)) v+= *pop(L);return v;}
		s() defined
		; global a = 1, b = 2;
		; L = list(&a, &b);
		; print s(L)
		3
		; b = 3;
		; print s(L)
		4

	    Octet-pointers, number-pointers, and string-pointers in
	    much the same way, but have not attempted to do much with
	    the latter two.

	    To print a pointer, use the "%p" specifier.

	    Some arithmetic operations has been defined for corresponding
	    C operations.  For example:

		; A = mat[4];
		; p = &A[0];
		; *(p+2) == A[2]
		; ++p
		; *p == A[1]

	    There is at present no protection against "illegal" use of &
	    and *, e.g. if one attempts here to assign a value to *(p+5),
	    or to use p after assigning another value to A.

	    NOTE: Unlike C, in calc &A[0] and A are quite different things.

	    NOTE: If the current value of a variable X is an octet,
	    number or string, *X may be used to to return the value of
	    X; in effect X is an address and *X is the value at X.

	    Added isptr(p) builtin to return 0 is p is not a pointer,
	    and >0 if it is a pointer.  The value of isptr(p) comes from
	    the V_XYZ #define (see the top of value.h) of the value to
	    which p points.

	    To allow & to be used as a C-like address operator, use of it
	    has been dropped in calls to user-defined functions.  For the
	    time being I have replaced it by the back-quote `.	For example:

		; global a
		; define f(a,b) = a = b
		; f(&a,5)
		; print a
		0
		; f(`a,5)
		; print a
		5

	   However, one may use & in a similar way as in:

		; define g(a,b) = *a = b
		; g(&a, 7)
		; print a
		7

	   There is no hashvalue for pointers. Thus, like error values,
	   they cannot be used as indices in an association.

	   The -> also works in calc. For example:

		; obj xy {x,y}
		; obj uvw {u, v, w}
		; obj xy A = {1,2}
		; obj uvw B = {3,4,5}
		; p = &A
		; q = &B
		; p->x
			1
		; p->y = 6
		; A
			obj xy {1, 6}
		; q -> u
			3
		; p->y = q
		; A
			obj xy {1, v-ptr: 1400474c0}
		; p->y->u
			3
		; p->y->u = 7
		; B
			obj uvw {7, 4, 5}
		; p -> y = p
		; A
			obj xy {1, v-ptr: 140047490}
		; p -> y -> x
			1
		; p->y->y
			v-ptr: 140047490
		; p->y->y-> x
			1
		; p->y->y->x = 8
		; A
			obj xy {8, v-ptr: 140047490}


	(2) a method of "protecting" variables;

	    For the various kinds of "protection", of an l_value var,
	    bits of var->v_subtype, of which only bits 0 and 1 have been
	    used in the past to indicate literal and allocated strings.
	    This has meant initialization of var->v_subtype when a new var
	    is introduced, and for assignments, etc., examination of the
	    appropriate bits to confirm that the operation is to be permitted.

	    See help/protect for details.

	(3) automatic "freeing" of constants that are no longer required.

	    For the "freeing" of constants, the definition of a NUMBER
	    structure so that a NUMBER * q could be regarded as a
	    pointing to a "freed number" if q->links = 0.

	    The old q->num was changed to a union q->nu which had a pointer
	    to the old q->num if q->links > 0 and to the next freed number
	    if q->links = 0.  The old "num" is #defined to "nu->n_num".

	    The prior method calc has used for handling "constants" amounted
	    to leakage.	 After:

		; define f(x) = 27 + x;
		; a = 27;

	    It is of course necessary for the constant 27 to be stored, but
	    if one now redefines f and a by:

		; define f(x) = 45 + x;
		; a = 45;

	    There seems little point in retaining 27 as a constant and
	    therefore using up memory.	If this example seems trivial,
	    replace 27 with a few larger numbers like 2e12345, or better,
	    -2e12345, for which calc needs memory for both 2e12345 and
	    -2e12345!

	    Constants are automatically freed a definition when a
	    function is re- or un-defined.

	    The qalloc(q) and qfree(q) functions have been changed so
	    that that q->links = 0 is permitted and indicates that q
	    has been freed.  If a number has been introduced as a
	    constant, i.e. by a literal numeral as in the above
	    examples, its links becoming zero indicates that it is no
	    longer required and its position in the table of constants
	    becomes available for a later new constant.

	(4) extension of transcendental functions like tan, tanh, etc.
	    to complex arguments

	(5) definition of gd(z) and agd(z), i.e. the gudermannian and
	    inverse gudermannian

	(6) introduction of show options for displaying information about
	    current constants, global variables, static variables, and cached
	    redc moduli.

	    To help you follow what is going on, the following show
	    items have been introduced:

		show constants ==> display the currently stored constants
		show numbers   ==> display the currently stored numbers
		show redcdata  ==> display the currently stored redc moduli
		show statics   ==> display info about static variables
		show real      ==> display only real-valued variables

	    The constants are automatically initialized as constants and
	    should always appear, with links >= 1, in in the list of constants.

	    The show command:

		show globals

	    has been redefined so that it gives information about all
	    current global and still active static variables.

	(7) definition of functions for freeing globals, statics, redc values

	    To free memory used by different kinds of variable, the following
	    builtins have been added:

		freeglobals();		/* free all globals */
		freestatics();		/* free all statics */
		freeredc();		/* free redc moduli */
		free(a, b, ...);	/* free specific variables */

	   NOTE: These functions do not "undefine" the variables, but
	   have the effect of assigning the null value to them, and so
	   frees the memory used for elements of a list, matrix or object.

	   See 10) below for info about "undefine *".

	(8) enhancement of handling of "old value": having it return an
	    lvalue and giving option of disabling updating.

	    Now, by default, "." return an lvalue with the appropriate
	    value instead of copying the old value.

	    So that a string of commands may be given without changing
	    the "oldvalue", the new builtin:

		saveval(0)

	    function simply disables the updating of the "." value.
	    The default updating can be resumed by calling:

		saveval(1)

	    The "." value:

		; 2 + 2
		4
		; .
		4

	    can now be treated as an unnamed variable.	For example:

		; mat x[3,3]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
		; x
		; print .[1,2]
		6

	(9) for a list L defining L[i] to be same as L[[i]]

	(10) extending undefine to permit its application to all user-defined
	     functions by using "undefine *".

	     The command:

		undefine *

	     undefines all current user-defined functions.  After
	     executing all the above freeing functions (and if
	     necessary free(.) to free the current "old value"), the
	     only remaining numbers as displayed by:

		show numbers

	     should be those associated with epsilon(), and if it has been
	     called, qpi().

	(11) storing the most recently calculated value of qpi(epsilon)i and
	     epsilon so that when called again with the same epsilon it
	     is copied rather than recalculated.

	(12) defining trace() for square matrices

	(13) expression in parentheses may now be followed by a qualifier
	     computable with its type

	     When an expression in parentheses evaluates to an lvalue
	     whose current value is a matrix, list or object, it may
	     now be followed by a qualifier compatible with its type.

	     For example:

		; A = list(1,2,4);
		; B = mat[2,2] = {5,6,7,8};
		; define f(x) = (x ? A : B)[[1]];
		; print f(1), f(0)
		2 6

		; obj xy {x,y}
		; C = obj xy = {4,5}
		; p = &C
		; *p.x
		Not indexing matrix or object
		; (*p).x
		4

	(14) swap(a,b) now permits swapping of octets in the same or different
	     blocks.

	     For example:

		; A = blk() = {1,2,3}
		; B = blk() = {4,5,6}
		; swap(A[0], B[2])
		; A
			chunksize = 256, maxsize = 256, datalen = 3
			060203

    A few bug fixes from Ernest Bowen:

	B1: qcmpi(q, n) in qmath.c sometimes gave the wrong result if
		LONG_BITS > BASEB, len = 1 and nf = 0, since it then
		reduces to the value of (nf != q->num.v[1]) in which
		q->num.v[1] is not part of the size-1 array of HALFs for
		q->num.	 At present this is used only for changing opcodes
		for ^2 and ^4 from sequences involving OP_POWER to
		sequences using OP_SQUARE, which has no effect on the
		results of calculations.

	B2: in matdet(m) in matfunc.c, a copy of the matrix m was not freed
		when the determinant turned out have zero value.

	B3: in f_search() in func.c, a qlinking of the NUMBER * storing the
		the size of a file was not qfreed.

	B4: in comalloc() in commath.c the initial zero values for real and
		imag parts are qlinked but not qfreed when nonzero values are
		assigned to them.  Rather than changing
		the definition of comalloc(), I have included any relevant
		qfrees with the calls to comalloc() as in
			c = comalloc();
			qfree(c->real);
			c->real = ...

	B5: in calls to matsum(), zeros are qlinked but not qfreed.  Rather
		than changing addnumeric(), I have changed the definition
		of matsum(m) so that it simply adds the components of m,
		which requires only that the relevant additions be defined,
		not that all components of m be numbers.


    Simple arithmetic expressions with literal numbers are evaluated
    during compilation rather than execution.  So:

	define f(x) = 2 + 3 + x;

    will be stored as if defined by:

	define f(x) = 5 + x;

    Fixed bug with lowhex2bin conversation in lib_util.c.  It did not
    correctly convert from hex ASCII to binary values due to a table
    loading error.

    Fixed porting problem for NetBSD and FreeBSD by renaming the
    qdiv() function in qmath.c to qqdiv().

    Improved the speed of mfactor (from mfactor.cal library) for
    long Mersenne factorizations.  The default reporting loop
    is now 10000 cycles.

    SGI Mips r10k compile set is specified for IRIX6.5 with v7.2
    compilers.	A note for pre-IRIX6.5 and/or pre-v7.2 compilers
    is given in the compile set.

    Added regression tests related to saveval(), dot and pointers.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.10.3t5.11 to 2.10.3t5.27:

    The todo help file as been updated with the in-progress items:

	xxx - block print function is not written yet ...

    Expanded the role of blk() to produce unnamed blocks as in:

		B = blk(len, chunk)

    and named blocks as in:

		B = blk(str, len, chunk)

    A block may be changed (with possible loss of data only if len is less
    than the old len) by:

		C = blk(B, len, chunk)

    For an unnamed block B, this creates a new block C and copies
    min(len, oldlen) octets to it, B remaining unchanged.   For a named
    block, the block B is changed and C refers to the same block as B,
    so that for example, C[i] = x will result in B[i] == x.  Thus, for a
    named block, "B = " does nothing (other than B = B) in:

		B = blk(B, len, chunk)

    but is necessary for changing an unnamed block.

    Renamed rmblk() to blkfree().

    The builtin function blkfree(val) will free memory allocated to block.
    If val is a named block, or the name of a named block, or the
    identifying index for a named block, blkfree(val) frees the
    memory block allocated to this named block.	 The block remains
    in existence with the same name, identifying index, and chunksize,
    but its size and maxsize becomes zero and the pointer for the start
    of its data block null.

    The builtin function blocks() returns the number of blocks that
    have been created but not freed by the blkfree() function.	When called
    as blocks(id) and the argument id less than the number of named
    blocks that have been created, blocks(id) returns the named block
    with identifying index id.

    Removed the artificial limit of 20 named blocks.

    Added name() builtin to return the name of a type of value
    as a string.

    Added isdefined() to determine of a value is defined.

    Added isobjtype() to determine the type of an object.

    The isatty(v) builtin will return 1 if v is a file that associated
    with a tty (terminal, xterm, etc.) and 0 otherwise.	 The isatty(v)
    builtin will no longer return an error if v is not a file or
    is a closed file.

    The isident(m) builtin will return 1 if m is a  identity matrix
    and 0 otherwise.  The isident(m) builtin will no longer return an
    error if m is not a matrix.

    Added extensive testing of isxxx() builtins and their operations
    on various types.

    Added md5() builtin to perform the MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm.

    Renamed isset() to bit().

    Blocks will expand when required by the copy() builtin function:

	; f = fopen("help/full", "r")
	; B = blk()
	; B
		chunksize = 256, maxsize = 256, datalen = 0
	; copy(B, f)
	; B
		chunksize = 256, maxsize = 310272, datalen = 310084
		2a2a2a2a2a2a2a2a2a2a2a2a2a0a2a20696e74726f0a2a2a2a2a2a2a2a2a...

	NOTE: Your results will differ because changes to help/full.

    The blkcpy() builtin args now more closely match that
    of memcpy(), strncpy:

	blkcpy(dst, src [, num [, dsi [, ssi]]])

    The copy() builtin args now more closely match that the cp command:

	copy(src, dst [, num [, ssi [, dsi]]])

    but otherwise does the same thing as blkcpy.

    Fixed lint problems for SunOS.

    Added have_memmv.c and HAVE_MEMMOVE Makefile variable to control
    use of memmove().  If empty, then memmove() is tested for and if
    not found, or if HAVE_MEMMOVE= -DHAVE_NO_MEMMOVE then an internal
    version of memmove() is used instead.

    Added regression tests for sha, sha1 and md5 builtin hash functions.

    Added xx_print to to the list of object routines are definable.
    Added xx_print.cal to the library to demo this feature.

    Moved blkcpy() routines have been moved to blkcpy.[ch].

    The blkcpy() & copy() builtins can not copy to/from numbers.
    For purposes of the copy, only the numerator is ignored.

    Resolved a number of missing symbols for libcalc users.

    Added lib_util.{c,h} to the calc source to support users of
    libcalc.a.	These utility routines are not directly used by
    calc but are otherwise have utility to those programmers who
    directly use libcalc.a instead.

    Added sample sub-directory.	 This sub-directory contains a few
    sample programs that use libcalc.a.	 These sample programs are
    built via the all rule because they will help check to see that
    libcalc.a library does not contain external references that
    cannot be resolved.	 At the current time none of these sample
    programs are installed.

    Added a libcalc_call_me_last() call to return storage created
    by the libcalc_call_me_first() call.  This allows users of libcalc.a
    to free up a small amount of storage.

    Fixed some memory leaks associated with the random() Blum generator.

    Fixed fseek() file operations for SunOS.

    Fixed convz2hex() fencepost error.	It also removes leading 0's.

    Plugged a memory leak relating to pmod.  The following calculation:

	pmod(2, x, something)

    where x was not 2^n-1 would leak memory.  This has been fixed.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.10.3t5.1 to 2.10.3t5.10:

    Misc printf warning bug fixes.

    Calc now permits chains of initializations as in:

		obj point {x,y} P = {1,2} = {3,4} = {5,6}

    Here the initializations are applied from left to right.  It may
    look silly, but the 1, 2, ... could be replaced by expressions with
    side effects.  As an example of its use suppose A and B are
    expressions with side effects:

		P = {A, B}

    has the effect of P.x = A; P.y = B.	 Sometimes one might want these in
    the reverse order: P.y = B; P.x = A.  This is achieved by:

		P = { , B} = {A}

    Another example of its use:

		obj point Q = {P, P} = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}

    which results in Q having Q.x.x = 1, Q.x.y = 2, etc.

    The role of the comma in has been changed.	Expressions such as:

		mat A[2], B[3]

    are equivalent to:

		(mat A[2]), (mat B[3])

    Now, expr1, expr2  returns type of expr2 rather than EXPR_RVALUE.  This
    permits expressions such as:

		(a = 2, b) = 3

    Also, expr1 ? expr2 : expr3	 returns type(expr2) | type(expr3).
    This will make the result an lvalue (i.e. EXPR_RVALUE bit not set)
    For example, if both expr2 and expr3 are lvalues.  Then:

		a ? b : c = d

    has the effect of b = d if a is "nonzero", otherwise c = d.

    This may be compared with

		d = a ? b : c

    which does d = b if a is "nonzero", otherwise d = c.

    And now, expr1 || expr2 and expr1 && expr2 each return
    htype(expr1)| type(expr2).	So for example:

		a || b = c

    has the effect of a = c if a is "nonzero", otherwise b = c.
    And for example:

		a && b = c

    has the effect of a = c if a is "zero", otherwise b = c.

    At top level, newlines are neglected between '(' and the matching
    ')' in expressions and function calls.  For example, if f() has been
    already defined, then:


		a = (
			2
			+
			f
			(
			3
			)
		    )

    and

		b = sqrt (
			20
			,
			1
		    )

    will be accepted, and in interactive mode the continue-line prompt
    will be displayed.

    When calc sees a "for", "while", "do", or "switch", newlines will be
    ignored (and the line-continuation prompt displayed in interactive mode)
    until the expected conditions and statements are completed.
    For example:

	s = 0;
	for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
	{
		s += i;
	}
	print s;

    Now 's' will print '10' instead of '5'.

    Added more regression tests to regress.cal.	 Changed the error
    counter from 'err' to 'prob'.  The errmax() is set very high and
    the expected value of errcount() is kept in ecnt.

    Added the 'unexpected' help file which gives some unexpected
    surprises that C programmers may encounter.

    Updated the 'help', 'intro' and 'overview' to reflect the
    full list of non-builtin function help files.  Reordered the
    'full' help file.

    The blkalloc() builtin has been renamed blk().

    Only a "fixed" type of BLOCK will be used.	Other types of
    blocks in the future will be different VALUE types.

    Introduced an undefine command so that

		    undefine f, g, ...

    frees the memory used to store code for user-defined functions f,
    g, ..., effectively removing them from the list of defined
    functions.

    When working from a terminal or when config("lib_debug") > 0 advice
    that a function has been defined, undefined, or redefined is
    displayed in format "f() defined".

    Some experimental changes to block and octet handling, so that after:

		    B = blk(N)

    B[i] for 0 <= i < N behaves for some operations like an lvalue for
    a USB8 in B.

    xx_assign added to object functions to permit the possibility of
    specifying what A = B will do if A is an xx-object.	 Normal
    assignment use of = is restored by the command: undefine
    xx_assign.

    For error-value err, errno(err) returns the error-code for err and
    stores this in calc_errno;	error(err) returns err as if
    error(errno(err)) were called.

    Anticipating probable future use, names have been introduced for
    the four characters @, #, $, `.  This completes the coverage of
    printable characters on a standard keyboard.

    Added sha() builtin to perform the old Secure Hash Algorithm
    (SHS FIPS Pub 180).

    Added sha1() builtin to perform the new Secure Hash Standard-1
    (SHS-1 FIPS Pub 180-1).

    Added ${LD_DEBUG} Makefile variable to allow for additional
    libraries to be compiled into calc ... for debugging purposes.
    In most cases, LD_DEBUG= is sufficient.

    Added ${CALC_ENV} makefile variable to allow for particular
    environment variables to be supplied for make {check,chk,debug}.
    In most cases, CALC_ENV= CALCPATH=./lib is sufficient.

    Added ${CALC_LIBS} to list the libraries created and used to
    build calc.	 The CALC_LIBS= custom/libcustcalc.a libcalc.a
    is standard for everyone.

    Improved how 'make calc' and 'make all' rules work with respect
    to building .h files.

    Added 'make run' to only run calc interactively with the
    ${CALC_ENV} calc environment.  Added 'make cvd', 'make dbx'
    and 'make gdb' rules to run debug calc with the respective
    debugger with the ${CALC_ENV} calc environment.

    Added cvmalloc_error() function to lib_calc.c as a hook for
    users of the SGI Workshop malloc debugging library.

    Cut down on places where *.h files include system files.
    The *.c should do that instead where it is reasonable.

    To avoid symbol conflicts, *.h files produced and shipped
    with calc are enclosed that as similar to the following:

	#if !defined(__CALC_H__)
	#define __CALC_H__
	..
	#endif /* !__CALC_H__ */

    Added memsize(x) builtin to print the best approximation of the
    size of 'x' including overhead.  The sizeof(x) builtin attempts
    to cover just the storage of the value and not the overhead.
    Because -1, 0 and 1 ZVALUES are static common values, sizeof(x)
    ignores their storage.  Also sizeof(x) ignores the denominator of
    integers, and the imaginary parts of pure real numbers.  Added
    regression tests for memsize(), sizeof() and size().


The following are the changes from calc version 2.10.3t4.16 to 2.10.3t5.0:

    The calc source now comes with a custom sub-directory which
    contains the custom interface code.	 The main Makefile now
    drives the building and installing of this code in a similar
    way that it drives the lib and help sub-directories.  (see below)

    Made minor edits to most help files beginning with a thru e.

    The errno(n) sets a C-like errno to the value n; errno() returns
    the current errno value.  The argument for strerror() and error()
    defaults to this errno.

    Added more error() and errno() regression tests.

    The convention of using the global variable lib_debug at the
    end of calc library scripts has been replaced with config("lib_debug").
    The "lib_debug" is reserved by convention for calc library scripts.
    This config parameter takes the place of the lib_debug global variable.
    By convention, "lib_debug" has the following meanings:

	<-1	no debug messages are printed though some internal
		    debug actions and information may be collected

	-1	no debug messages are printed, no debug actions will be taken

	0	only usage message regarding each important object are
		    printed at the time of the read (default)

	>0	messages regarding each important object are
		    printed at the time of the read in addition
		    to other debug messages

    The "calc_debug" is reserved by convention for internal calc routines.
    The output of "calc_debug" will change from release to release.
    Generally this value is used by calc wizards and by the regress.cal
    routine (make check).  By convention, "calc_debug" has the following
    meanings:

	<-1	reserved for future use

	-1	no debug messages are printed, no debug actions will be taken

	0	very little, if any debugging is performed (and then mostly
		    in alpha test code).  The only output is as a result of
		    internal fatal errors (typically either math_error() or
		    exit() will be called). (default)

	>0	a greater degree of debugging is performed and more
		    verbose messages are printed (regress.cal uses 1).

    The "user_debug" is provided for use by users.  Calc ignores this value
    other than to set it to 0 by default (for both "oldstd" and "newstd").
    No calc code or shipped library will change this value other than
    during startup or during a config("all", xyz) call.

    The following is suggested as a convention for use of "user_debug".
    These are only suggestions: feel free to use it as you like:

	<-1	no debug messages are printed though some internal
		    debug actions and information may be collected

	-1	no debug messages are printed, no debug actions will be taken

	0	very little, if any debugging is performed.  The only output
		    are from fatal errors. (default)

	>0	a greater degree of debugging is performed and more
		    verbose messages are printed

    Added more code related to the BLOCK type.

    Added blkalloc() builtin.

    Split NAMETYPE definition out into nametype.h.

    Added OCTET type for use in processing block[i].

    Added free, copy, cmp, quickhash and print functions for
    HASH, BLOCK and OCTET.

    Added notes to config.h about what needs to be looked at when
    new configuration items are added.

    The null() builtin now takes arguments.

    Given the following:

	obj point {x,y}
	obj point P, Q

    will will now create P and Q as obj point objects.

    Added xx_or, xx_and, xx_not and xx_fact objfuncs.

    Added the custom() builtin function.  The custom() builtin
    interface is designed to make it easier for local custom
    modification to be added to calc.  Custom functions are
    non-standard or non-portable code.	For these reasons, one must can
    only execute custom() code by way of an explicit action.

    By default, custom() returns an error.  A new calc command line
    option of '-C' is required (as well as ALLOW_CUSTOM= -DCUSTOM
    Makefile variable set) to enable it.

    Added -C as a calc command line option.  This permits the
    custom() interface to be used.

    Added ALLOW_CUSTOM Makefile variable to permanently disable
    or selective enable the custom builtin interface.

    The rm() builtin now takes multiple filenames.  If the first
    arg is "-f", then 'no-such-file' errors are ignored.

    Added errcount([count]) builtin to return or set the error
    counter.  Added errmax([limit]) to return or set the error
    count limiter.

    Added -n as a calc command line option.  This has the effect
    of calling config("all", "newstd") at startup time.

    Added -e as a calc command line option to ignore all environment
    variables at startup time.	The getenv() builtin function will
    still return values, however.

    Added -i as a calc command line option.  This has the effect
    ignoring when errcount() exceeds errmax().

    Changed the config("maxerr") name to config("maxscan").  The
    old name of "maxerr" is kept for backward compatibility.

    Using an unknown -flag on the calc command like will
    generate a short usage message.

    Doing a 'help calc' displays the same info as 'help usage'.

    The 'make check' rule now uses the -i calc command line flag
    so that regress.cal can continue beyond when errcount exceeds
    errmax.  In regress.cal, vrfy() reports when errcount exceeds
    errmax and resets errmax to match errcount.	 This check
    and report is independent of the test success of failure.

    Fixed missing or out of order tests in regress.cal.

    Misc Makefile cleanup in lib/Makefile and help/Makefile.

    The default errmax() value on startup is now 20.

    The custom() interface is now complete.  See help/custom and
    custom/HOW_TO_ADD files, which show up as the custom and new_custom
    help files, for more information.

    The help command will search ${LIBDIR}/custhelp if it fails to find
    a file in ${LIBDIR}.  This allows the help command to also print
    help for a custom function.	 However if a standard help file and a
    custom help file share the same name, help will only print the
    standard help file.	 One can skip the standard help file and print
    the custom help file by:

	help custhelp/name

    or by:

	custom("help", "name")

    Added minor sanity checks the help command's filename.

    Added show custom to display custom function information.

    Added the contrib help page to give information on how
    and where to submit new calc code, modes or custom functions.

    Added comment information to value.h about what needs to be
    checked or modified when a new value type is added.

    Both size(x) and sizeof(x) return information on all value types.
    Moved size and sizeof information from func.c and into new file: size.c.

    Added custom("devnull") to serve as a do-nothing interface tester.

    Added custom("argv" [,arg ...]) to print information about args.

    Added custom("sysinfo", "item") to print an internal calc #define
    parameter.

    The make depend rule also processes the custom/Makefile.

    Added xx_max and xx_min for objfuncs.

    The max(), min() builtins work for lists.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.10.3t3 to 2.10.3t4.15:

    The priority of unary + and - to that of binary + and - when they are
    applied to a first or only term.  Thus:

	-16^-2 == -1/256
	-7^2 == -49
	-3! == -6

    Running ranlib is no longer the default.  Systems that need RANLIB
    should edit the Makefile and comment back in:

	RANLIB=ranlib

    Dropped support of SGI r8k.

    Added support for the SGI r5k.

    Added support for SGI Mips compiler version 7.1 or later.

    Removed "random" as a config() option.

    Removed CCZPRIME Makefile variable.

    Added zsquaremod() back into zmod.c to be used by the Blum-Blum-Shub
    generator for the special case of needing x^2 mod y.

    Moved the Blum-Blum-Shub code and defines from zrand.c and zrand.h
    into zrandom.c and zrandom.h.  Now only the a55 generator resides
    in zrand.c and zrand.h.

    Added random, srandom and randombit help files.

    Added random(), srandom() and randombit() builtin functions.  The
    cryptographically strong random number generator is code complete!

    Removed cryrand.cal now that a Blum-Blum-Shub generator is builtin.

    Improved the speed of seedrandom.cal.  It now uses the 13th
    builtin Blum-Blum-Shub seed.

    The randmprime.cal script makes use of the Blum-Blum-Shub generator.

    Added randombitrun.cal and randomrun.cal calc library files.
    These are the Blum-Blum-Shub analogs to the randbitrun.cal
    and randrun.cal a55 tests.

    Improved hash.c interface to lower level hash functions.  The hash
    interface does not yet have a func.c interface ...	it is still
    under test.

    Added randombitrun.cal to test the Blum-Blum-Shub generator.

    Added calc.h, hash.h, shs.h and value.h to LIB_H_SRC because some
    of the libcalc.a files need them.

    In the original version, each call to newerror(str) created a new
    error-value.  Now a new value will be created only if str has not
    been used in a previous call to newerror().	 In effect, the string
    serves to identify the error-value; for example:

	    return newerror("Non-integer argument");

    can be used in one or more functions, some of which may be
    repeatedly called, but after it has been called once, it will
    always return the same value as if one had initially used the
    assignment:

	    non_integer_argument_error = newerror("Non-integer argument")

    and then in each function used:

	    return non_integer_argument_error;

    The new definition of newerror() permits its freer use in cases like:

	    define foo(a) {

		    if (!isint(a))
			    return newerror("Non-integer argument");
		    ...
	    }

    One might say that "new" in "newerror" used to mean being different
    from any earlier error-value.  Now it means being not one of the
    "original" or "old" error-values defined internally by calc.

    As newerror() and newerror("") specify no non-null string, it has
    been arranged that they return the same as newerror("???").

    Added "show errors" command analogous to "show functions" for
    user-defined functions.  One difference is that whereas the
    functions are created by explicit definitions, a new described
    error is created only when a newerror(...) is executed.

    Fixed macro symbol substitution problem uncovered by HPUX cpp bug in
    HVAL and related zrand.h macros.

    Added +e to CCMISC for HP-UX users.

    Fixed the prompt bug.

    Eliminated the hash_init() initialization function.

    The 'struct block' has been moved from value.c to a new file: block.h.

    Added "blkmaxprint" config value, which limits the octets to print
    for a block.  A "blkmaxprint" of 0 means to print all octets of a
    block, regardless of size.	The default is to print only the first
    256 octets.

    The "blkverbose" determines if all lines, including duplicates
    should be printed.	If TRUE, then all lines are printed.  If false,
    duplicate lines are skipped and only a "*" is printed in a style
    similar to od.  This config value has not meaning if "blkfmt" is
    "str".  The default value for "blkverbose" is FALSE: duplicate
    lines are not printed.

    The "blkbase" determines the base in which octets of a block
    are printed.  Possible values are:

	"hexadecimal"		Octets printed in 2 digit hex
	"hex"

	"octal"			Octets printed in 3 digit octal
	"oct"

	"character"		Octets printed as chars with non-printing
	"char"			    chars as \123 or \n, \t, \r

	"binary"		Octets printed as 0 or 1 chars
	"bin"

	"raw"			Octets printed as is, i.e. raw binary
	"none"

    The default "blkbase" is "hex".

    The "blkfmt" determines for format of how block are printed:

	"line"		print in lines of up to 79 chars + newline
	"lines"

	"str"		print as one long string
	"string"
	"strings"

	"od"		print in od-like format, with leading offset,
	"odstyle"	   followed by octets in the given base
	"od_style"

	"hd"		print in hex dump format, with leading offset,
	"hdstyle"	   followed by octets in the given base, followed
	"hd_style"	   by chars or '.' if no-printable or blank

    The default "blkfmt" is "hd".

    Fixed a bug in coth() when testing acoth using coth(acoth(x)) == x
    within the rounding error.

    Assignments to matrices and objects has been changed.  The assignments in:

	A = list(1,2,3,4);
	B = makelist(4) = {1,2,3,4};

    will result in A == B.  Then:

	A = {,,5}

    will result in A == list(1,2,5,4).

    Made minor edits to most help files beginning with a thru d.

    Fixed error in using cmdbuf("").


The following are the changes from calc version 2.10.3t0 to 2.10.3t2:

    Bumped to version 2.10.3 due to the amount of changes.

    Renamed qabs() to qqabs() to avoid conflicts with stdlib.h.

    Fixed a casting problem in label.c.

    A lot of work was performed on the code generation by Ernest Bowen
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>.	 Declarations no longer
    need to precede code:

	define f(x) {
		local i = x^2;
		print "i = ":i;
		local j = i;
		...
	}

    The scope of a variable extends from the end of the declaration (including
    initialization code for the variable) at which it is first created
    to the limit given by the following rules:

	local variable: to the end of the function being defined

	global variable: to the end of the session with calc

	static within a function definition: to the first of:

	    an end of a global, static or local declaration (including
	    initialization code) with the same identifier

	    the end of the definition

	static at top level within a file: to the first of:

	    the next static declaration of the identifier at top level
	    in the file,

	    the next global declaration of the identifier at top level
	    in the file or in any function definition in the file,

	    the next global declaration of the identifier at any level
	    in a file being read as a result of a "read" command,

	    the end of the file.

    The scope of a top-level global or static variable may be
    interrupted by the use of the identifier as a parameter or local or
    static variable within a function definition in the file being
    read; it is restored (without change of value) after the definition.

    For example, The two static variables a and b are created,
    with zero value, when the definition is read; a is initialized
    with the value x if and when f(x) is first called with a positive
    even x, b is similarly initialized if and when f(x) is first called
    positive odd x.  Each time f(x) is called with positive integer x,
    a or b is incremented.  Finally the values of the static variables
    are assigned to the global variables a and b, and the resulting
    values displayed.  Immediately after the last of several calls to
    f(x), a = 0 if none of the x's have been positive even, otherwise
    a = the first positive even x + the number of positive even x's,
    and b = 0 if none of the x's have been positive odd, otherwise
    b = the first positive odd x + the number of positive odd x's:

	define f(x) {
		if (isint(x) && x > 0) {
			if (iseven(x)) {
				static a = x;
				a++;
			} else {
				static b = x;
				b++;
			}
		}
		global a = a, b = b;
		print "a =",a,"b =",b;
	}

    Fixed some faults in the handling of syntax errors for the matrix
    and object creation operators mat and obj.	In previous versions of calc:

	mat;				<- Bad dimension 0 for matrix
	mat A;				<- Bad dimension 0 for matrix
	global mat A;			<- Bad dimension 0 for matrix
	mat A[2], mat B[3]		<- Semicolon expected
	global mat A[2], mat B[3]	<- Bad syntax in declaration statement

    Now:

	this statement			has the same effect as
	--------------			----------------------
	mat A[2], B[3]			(A = mat[2]), B[3]

	global mat A[2], B[3]		global A, B; A = mat[2]; B = mat[3];

    Initialization remains essentially as before except that for objects,
    spaces between identifiers indicate assignments as in simple variable
    declarations.  Thus, after:

	obj point {x,y};
	obj point P, Q R = {1,2}

    P has {0,0}, Q and R have {1,2}.  In the corresponding expression with
    matrices commas between identifiers before the initialization are ignored.
    For example:

	this statement			has the same effect as
	--------------			----------------------
	mat A, B C [2] = {1,2}		A = B = C = (mat[2] = {1,2})

    One can also do things like:

	L = list(mat[2] = {1,2}, obj point = {3,4}, mat[2] = {5,6})
	A = mat[2,2] = {1,2,3,4}^2
	B = mat[2,2] = {1,2,3,4} * mat[2,2] = {5,6,7,8}

    where the initialization = has stronger binding than the assignment = and
    the * sign.

    Matrices and objects can be mixed in declarations after any simple
    variables as in:

	global a, b, mat A, B[2] = {3,4}, C[2] = {4,5}, obj point P = {5,6}, Q

    Fixed some bugs related to global and static scoping.  See the
    5200 regress test and lib/test5200.cal for details.

    Optimized opcode generator so that functions defined using '=' do not
    have two unreached opcodes.	 I.e.,:

	define f(x) = x^2
	show opcodes f

    Also unreachable opcodes UNDEF and RETURN are now not included at
    the end of any user-defined function.

    Changed the "no offset" indicator in label.c from 0 to -1; this
    permits goto jumps to the zero opcode position.

    Changed the opcode generation for "if (...)" followed by
    "break", "continue", or "goto", so that only one jump opcode is
    required.

    A label can now be immediately by a right-brace.  For example:

	define test_newop3(x) {if (x < 0) goto l132; ++x; l132: return x;}

    The LONG_BITS make variable, if set, will force the size of a long
    as well as forcing the USB8, SB8, USB16, SB16, USB32, SB32,
    HAVE_B64, USB64, SB64, U(x) and L(x) types.	 If the longbits
    program is given an arg (of 32 or 64), then it will output
    based on a generic 32 or 64 bit machine where the long is
    the same size as the wordsize.

    Fixed how the SVAL and HVAL macros were formed for BASEB==16 machines.

    Dropped explicit Makefile support for MIPS r8k since these processors
    no longer need special compiler flags.

    SGI 6.2 and later uses -xansi.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.10.2t33 to 2.10.2t34:

    Fixed a bug related to fact().

    Thanks to Ernest Bowen <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>,
    for two or three arguments,

	    search(x, val, start);
	    rsearch(x, val, start);

    and for matrix, list or association x:

	    search(f, str, start);
	    rsearch(f, str, start);

    for a file stream f open for reading, behave as before except for a few
    differences:

	(1) there are no limits on the integer-valued start.

	(2) negative values of start are interpreted as offsets from the size of
	    x and f.  For example,

		    search(x, val, -100)

	    searches the last 100 elements of x for the first i for which
	    x[[i]] = val.

	(3) for a file f, when start + strlen(str) >= size(f) and
	    search(f, str, start) returns null, i.e. str is
	    not found, the file position after the search will be

		    size(f) - strlen(str) + 1

	    rather than size(f).

    For four arguments:

	    search(a, b, c, d)
	    rsearch(a, b, c, d),

    a has the role of x or f, and b the role of val or str as described
    above for the three-argument case, and for search(), c is
    essentially "start" as before, but for rsearch() is better for c
    and d to be the same as for search().  For a non-file case, if:

	     0 <= c < d <= size(a),

    the index-interval over which the search is to take place is:

	     c <= i < d.

    If the user has defined a function accept(v,b), this is used rather
    than the test v == b to decide for matrix, list, or association
    searches when a "match" of v = a[[i]] with b occurs. E.g.  after:

	     define accept(v,b) = (v >= b);

    then calling:

	     search(a, 5, 100, 200)

    will return, if it exists, the smallest index i for which
    100 <= i < 200 and a[[i]] >= 5.  To restore the effect of
    the original "match" function, one would then have to:

	     define accept(v,b) == (v == b).

    Renamed the calc symbol BYTE_ORDER to CALC_BYTE_ORDER in order
    to avoid conflict.

    Added beer.cal and hello.cal lib progs in support of:   :-)

	http://www.ionet.net/~timtroyr/funhouse/beer.html
	http://www.latech.edu/~acm/HelloWorld.shtml


The following are the changes from calc version 2.10.2t25 to 2.10.2t32:

    Eliminated use of VARARG and <varargs.h>.  Calc supports only
    <stdarg.h>.	 The VARARGS Makefile variable has been eliminated.

    Source is converted to ANSI C.  In particular, functions
    will now have ANSI C style args.  Any comments from old K&R
    style args have been moved to function comment section.

    Removed prototype.h.  The PROTO() macro is no longer needed
    or supported.

    Added mfactor.cal to find the smallest factor of a Mersenne number.

    The built .h file: have_times.h, determines if the system has
    <time.h>, <times.h>, <sys/time.h> and <sys/times.h>.

    Because shs.c depends on HASHFUNC, which in turn depends on
    VALUE, shs.o has been moved out of libcalc.a.  For the same
    reasons, hash.h and shs.h are not being installed into
    the ${LIBDIR} for now.

    A number of the regression tests that need random numbers now
    use different seeds.

    Fixes for compiling under BSDI's BSD/OS 2.0.  Added a Makefile
    section for BSD/OS.

    Added a Makefile compile section for Dec Alpha without gcc ...
    provides a hack-a-round for Dec Alpha cc bug.

    Minor comment changes to lucas.cal.

    Added pix.cal, a slow painful but interesting way to compute pix(x).

    Confusion over the scope of static and global values has been reduced
    by a patch from Ernest Bowen <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>.

	The change introduced by the following patch terminates the
	scope of a static variable at any static declaration with the
	same name at the same level, or at any global declaration with
	the same name at any level.  With the example above, the scope
	of the static "a" introduced in the third line ends when the
	"global a" is read in the last line.  Thus one may now use the
	same name in several "static" areas as in:

	    ; static a = 10;
	    ; define f(x) = a + x;
	    ; static a = 20;
	    ; define g(x) = a + x;
	    ; global a;

	The first "a" exists only for the definition of f(); the second
	"a" only for the definition of g().  At the end one has only
	the global "a".

	Ending the scope of a static variable in this way is consistent
	with the normal use of static variables as in:

	    ; static a = 10;
	    ; define f(x) {static a = 20; return a++ + x;}
	    ; define g(x) = a + x;
	    ; global a;

	The scope of the first "a" is temporarily interrupted by the
	"static a" in the second line; the second "a" remains active
	until its scope ends with the ending of the definition of f().
	Thus one ends with g(x) = 10 + x and on successive calls to
	f(), f(x) returns 20 + x, 21 + x, etc.	With successive "static
	a" declarations at the same level, the active one at any stage
	is the most recent; if the instructions are being read from a
	file, the scope of the last "static a" ends at the end-of-file.

	Here I have assumed that no "global a" is encountered.	As
	there can be only one global variable with name "a", it seems
	to me that its use must end the scope of any static "a".  Thus
	the changes I introduce are such that after:

	    ; global a = 10;
	    ; define f(x) = a + x;
	    ; static a = 20;
	    ; define g(x) = a + x;
	    ; define h(x) {global a = 30; return a + x;}
	    ; define i(x) = a + x;

	g(x) will always return 20 + x, and until h(x) has been called,
	f(x) and i(x) will return 10 + x; when h(x) is called, it
	returns 30 + x and any later call to f(x) or i(x) will return
	30 + x.	 It is the reading of "global a" in the definition of
	h() that terminates the scope of the static a = 20, so that the
	"a" for the last line is the global variable defined in the
	first line.  The "a = 30" is executed only when h() is called.

	Users who find this confusing might be well advised to use
	different names for different variables at the same scope level.

	The other changes produced by the patch are more straightforward,
	but some tricky programming was needed to get the possibility of
	multiple assignments and what seems to be the appropriate order
	of executions and assignments.	For example, the order for the
	declaration:

		global a, b = expr1, c, d = expr2, e, f

	will be:

		evaluation of expr1;
		assignment to b;
		evaluation of expr2;
		assignment to d;

	Thus the effect is the same as for:

		a = 0; b = expr1; c = 0; d = expr2; e = 0; f = 0;

	The order is important when the same name is used for different
	variables in the same context.	E.g. one may have:

		define f(x) {
			global a = 10;
			static a = a;
			local a = a--;

			while (--a > 0)
				x++;
			return x;
		}

	Every time this is called, the global "a" is assigned the value
	10.  The first time it is called, the value 10 is passed on to
	the static "a" and then to the local "a".  In each later call
	the "static a = a" is ignored and the static "a" is one less than
	it was in the preceding call.  I'm not recommending this style of
	programming but it is good that calc will be able to handle it.

	I've also changed dumpop to do something recent versions do not do:
	distinguish between static and global variables with the same name.

	Other changes: commas may be replaced by spaces in a sequence of
	identifiers in a declaration. so one may now write:

		global a b c = 10, d e = 20

	The comma after the 10 is still required.  Multiple occurrences
	of an identifier in a local declaration are now acceptable as
	they are for global or static declarations:

		local a b c = 10, a = 20;

	does the same as:

		local a b c;
		a = b = c = 10;
		a = 20;

	The static case is different in that:

		static a b c = 10, a = 20;

	creates four static variables, the first "a" having a very short and
	useless life.

    Added new tests to verify the new assignments above.

    Added the builtin test(x) which returns 1 or 0 according as x tests
    as true or false for conditions.

    Added have_posscl.c which attempts to determine if FILEPOS is
    a scalar and defines HAVE_FILEPOS_SCALAR in have_posscl.h
    accordingly.  The Makefile variable HAVE_POSSCL determines
    if have_posscl.c will test this condition or assume non-scalar.

    Added have_offscl.c which attempts to determine if off_t is
    a scalar and defines HAVE_OFF_T_SCALAR in have_posscl.h
    accordingly.  The Makefile variable HAVE_OFFSCL determines
    if have_offscl.c will test this condition or assume non-scalar.

    Reading to EOF leaves you positioned one character beyond
    the last character in the file, just like Un*x read behavior.

    Calc supports files and offsets up to 2^64 bytes, if the OS
    and file system permits.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.10.2t4 to 2.10.2t24:

    Added makefile debugging rules:

	make chk	like a 'make check' (run the regression tests)
			except that only a few lines around interesting
			(and presumable error messages) are printed.
			No output if no errors are found.

	make env	print important makefile values

	make mkdebug	'make env' + version information and a
			make with verbose output and printing of
			constructed files

	make debug	'make mkdebug' with a 'make clobber'
			so that the entire make is verbose and
			a constructed files are printed

     Improved instructions in 'BUGS' section on reporting problems.
     In particular we made it easy for people to send in a full
     diagnostic output by sending 'debug.out' which is made as follows:

	make debug > debug.out

     Added -v to calc command line to print the version and exit.

     Fixed declarations of memcpy(), strcpy() and memset() in the
     case of them HAVE_NEWSTR is false.

     Fixed some compile time warnings.

     Attempting to rewind a file this is not open generates an error.

     Noted conversion problems in file.c in triple X comments.

     Some extremely brain dead shells cannot correctly deal with if
     clauses that do not have a non-empty else statement.  Their
     exit bogosity results in make problems.  As a work-a-round,
     Makefile if clauses have 'else true;' clauses for if statements
     that previously did not have an else clause.

     Fixed problems where the input stack depth reached the 10 levels.

     The show keyword is now a statement instead of a command:

	; define demo() {local f = open("foo", "w"); show files; fclose(f);}
	; demo()

     Added a new trace option for display of links to real and complex
     numbers.  This is activated by config("trace", 4).  The printing of
     a real number is immediately followed by "#" and the number of links
     to that number; complex numbers are printed in the same except for
     having "##" instead of "#".  <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

     The number of links for a number value is essentially the number of value
     locations at which it is either stored or deemed to be stored.  Here a
     number value is the result of a reading or evaluation; when the result
     is assigned to lvalues, "linking" rather than copying occurs.  Different
     sets of mutually linked values may contain the same number.  For example:

	a = b = 2 + 3; x, y = 2 + 3;

     a and b are linked, and x and y are linked, but a and x are not linked.

     Revised the credits help file and man page.  Added archive help
     file to indicate where recent versions of calc are available.

     The regression test suite output has been changed so that it will
     output the same information regardless of CPU performance.	 In
     particular, CPU times of certain tests are not printed.  This allows
     one to compare the regression output of two different systems easier.

     A matrix or object declaration is now considered an expression
     and returns a matrix or object of the specified type.  Thus one may
     use assignments like:

	A = mat[2];		/* same as: mat A[2]; */
	P = obj point;		/* same as: obj point P; */

     The obj and mat keywords may be with "local", "global", "static" as in:

	local mat A[2];

     Several matrices or objects may be assigned or declared in the one
     statement, as in:

	mat A, B[2], C[3];	/* same as: mat A[2], B[2], C[3] */

     except that only one matrix creation occurs and is copied as in:

	A = B = mat[2];

     Initialization of matrices and objects now occur before assignments:

	mat A, B [2] = {1,2};	/* same as: A = B = (mat[2] = {1,2}); */

     Missing arguments are considered as "no change" rather than
     "assign null values".  As in recent versions of calc, the default
     value assigned to matrix elements is zero and the default for object
     elements is a null value).	 Thus:

	mat A[2] = {1,2};
	A = { , 3};

     will change the value of A to {1,3}.

     If the relevant operation exists for matrices or has been defined for
     the type of object A is, the assignment = may be combined with +, -, *,
     etc. as in:

	A += {3, 4};		/* same as: A[0] += 3; A[1] += 4; */
	A += { };		/* same as: A += A; */

     In (non-local) declarations, the earlier value of a variable may be
     used in the initialization list:

	mat A[3]={1,2,3}; mat A[3]={A[2],A[1],A[0]}; /* same as: A={3,2,1} */

     Also:

	mat A[3] = {1,2,3};
	mat A[3] = {A, A, A};

     produces a 3-element matrix, each of whose elements is a 3-element matrix.

     The notation A[i][j] requires A[i] to be a matrix, whereas B[i,j]
     accesses an element in a 2-dimensional matrix.  Thus:

	B == A[i]	implies		A[i][j] = B[j]

     There is requirement in the use of A[i][j] that the matrices A[i]
     for i = 0, 1, ... all be of the same size.	 Thus:

	mat A[3] = {(mat[2]), (mat[3]), (mat[2])};

     produces a matrix with a 7-element structure:

	A[0][0], A[0][1], A[1][0], A[1][1], A[1][2], A[2][0], A[2][1]

     One can initialize matrices and objects whose elements are matrices
     and/or objects:

	obj point {x,y}
	obj point P;
	obj point A = {P,P};

     or:

	obj point {x,y};
	obj point P;
	mat A[2] = {P,P};
	A = {{1,2}, {3,4}};

     The config("trace", 8) causes opcodes of newly defined functions
     are displayed.  Also show can now show the opcodes for a function.
     For example:

	config("trace", 8);
	define f(x) = x^2;
	show opcodes f;
	define g(x,y) {static mat A[2]; A += {x,y}; return A;}
	show opcodes g
	g(2,3);
	show opcodes g;
	g(3,4);

     The two sequences displayed for f should show the different ways
     the parameter is displayed.  The third sequence for g should also
     show the effects of the static declaration of A.

     Fixed a number of compiler warning and type cast problems.

     Added a number of new error codes.

     Misc bug fixes for gcc2 based Sparc systems.

     Fixed a bug in the SVAL() macro on systems with 'long long'
     type and on systems with 16 bit HALFs.

     Reduced the Makefile CC set:

	 CCOPT are flags given to ${CC} for optimization
	 CCWARN are flags given to ${CC} for warning message control
	 CCMISC are misc flags given to ${CC}

	 CFLAGS are all flags given to ${CC}
		[[often includes CCOPT, CCWARN, CCMISC]]
	 ICFLAGS are given to ${CC} for intermediate progs

	 CCMAIN are flags for ${CC} when files with main() instead of CFLAGS
	 CCSHS are flags given to ${CC} for compiling shs.c instead of CFLAGS

	 LCFLAGS are CC-style flags for ${LINT}
	 LDFLAGS are flags given to ${CC} for linking .o files
	 ILDFLAGS are flags given to ${CC} for linking .o files
		  for intermediate progs

	 CC is how the C compiler is invoked

    Added more tests to regress.cal.

    Port to HP-UX.

    Moved config_print() from config.c to value.c so prevent printvalue()
    and freevalue() from being unresolved symbols for libcalc.a users.

    Calc will generate "maximum depth reached" messages or errors when
    reading or eval() is attempted at maximum input depth.

    Now each invocation of make is done via ${MAKE} and includes:

	MAKE_FILE=${MAKE_FILE}
	TOPDIR=${TOPDIR}
	LIBDIR=${LIBDIR}
	HELPDIR=${HELPDIR}

    Setting MAKE_FILE= will cause make to not re-make if the Makefile
    is edited.

    Added libinit.c which contains the function libcalc_call_me_first().
    Users of libcalc.a MUST CALL libcalc_call_me_first BEFORE THEY USE
    ANY OTHER libcalc.a functions!

    Added support for the SGI IRIX6.2 (or later) Mongoose 7.0 (or later)
    C Compiler for the r4k, r8k and r10k.  Added LD_NO_SHARED for
    non-shared linker support.

    Re-ordered and expanded options for the DEBUG make variable.

    Make a few minor cosmetic comment changes/fixes in the main Makefile.

    Statements such as:

		mat A[2][3];

    now to the same as:

		mat M[3];
		mat A[2] = {M, M};

    To initialize such an A one can use a statement like

		A = {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6}};

    or combine initialization with creation by:

		mat A[2][3] = {{1,2,3}, {4,5,6}};

    One would then have, for example, A[1][0] = 4.  Also, the inner braces
    cannot be removed from the initialization for A:

		mat A[2][3] = {1,2};

    results in exactly the same as:

		mat A[2] = {1,2};

    Added rm("file") builtin to remove a file.

    The regress test sections that create files also use rm() to remove
    them before and afterward.

    Added 4400-4500 set to test new mat and obj initialization rules.

    Added 4600 to test version file operations.

    Added CCZPRIME Makefile variable to the set for the short term
    to work around a CC -O2 bug on some SGI machines.

    Added regression test of _ variables and function names.

    Added read of read and write, including read and write test for
    long strings.

    Fixed bug associated with read of a long string variable.

    Renumbered some of the early regress.cal test numbers to make room
    for more tests.  Fixed all out of sequence test numbers.  Fixed some
    malformed regression reports.

    Renamed STSIZE_BITS to OFF_T_BITS.	Renamed SWAP_HALF_IN_STSIZE to
    SWAP_HALF_IN_OFF_T.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.10.2t1 to 2.10.2t3:

    Fixed bug in the regression suite that made test3400 and test4100
    fail on correct computations.

    The randbit() builtin, when given to argument, returns 1 random bit.

    Fixed a bug in longlong.c which made is generate a syntax error
    on systems such as the PowerPC where the make variable LONGLONG
    was left empty.

    By default, the Makefile leaves LONGLONG_BITS empty to allow for
    testing of 64 bit data types.  A few hosts may have problems with
    this, but hopefully not.  Such hosts can revert back to LONGLONG_BITS=0.

    Improved SGI support.  Understands SGI IRIX6.2 performance issues
    for multiple architectures.

    Fixed a number of implicit conversion from unsigned long to long to avoid
    unexpected rounding, sign extension, or loss of accuracy side effects.

    Added SHSCC because shs.c contains a large expression that some
    systems need help in optimizing.

    Added "show files" to display information about all currently open files.

    Calc now prevents user-defined function having the same name as a
    builtin function.

    A number of new error codes (more than 100) have been added.

    Added ctime() builtin for date and time as string value.
    Added time() builtin for seconds since 00:00:00 1 Jan 1970 UTC.
    Added strerror() builtin for string describing error type.
    Added freopen() builtin to reopen a file.
    Added frewind() builtin to rewind a file.
    Added fputstr() builtin to write a null-terminated string to a file.
    Added fgetstr() builtin to read a null-terminated string from a file.
    Added fgetfield() builtin to read next field from file.
    Added strscan() builtin to scan a string.
    Added scan() builtin to scan of a file.
    Added fscan() builtin to scan of a file.
    Added fscanf() builtin to do a formatted scan of a file.
    Added scanf() builtin to do a formatted scan of stdin.
    Added strscanf() builtin to do a formatted scan of a string.
    Added ungetc() builtin to unget character read from a file.

    As before, files opened with fopen() will have an id different from
    earlier files.  But instead of returning the id to the FILEIO slot
    used to store information about it, calc simply uses consecutive
    numbers starting with 3.  A calc file retains its id, even when the
    file has been closed.

    The builtin files(i) now returns the file opened with id == i
    rather than the file with slot number i.  For any i <= lastid,
    files(i) has at some time been opened.  Whether open or closed, it
    may be "reopened" with the freopen() command.  This write to a file
    and then read it, use:

	f = fopen("junk", "w")
	freopen(f, "r")

	To use the same stream f for a new file, one may use:

	    freopen(f, mode, newfilename)

	which closes f (assuming it is open) and then opens newfilename on f.

	And as before:

	    f = fopen("curds", "r")
	    g = fopen("curds", "r")

	results in two file ids (f and g) that refer to the same file
	name but with different pointers.

    Calc now understands "w+", "a+" and "r+" file modes.

    If calc opens a file without a mode there is a "guess" that mode
    "r+" will work for any files with small descriptors found to be
    open.  In case it doesn't (as apparently happens if the file had
    not been opened for both reading and reading) the function now also
    tries "w" and "r", and if none work, gives up.  This avoids having
    "open" files with null fp.

    The builtin rewind() calls the C rewind() function, but one may
    now rewind several files at once by a call like rewind(f1, f2).
    With no argument, rewind() rewinds all open files with id >= 3.

    The functions fputstr(), fgetstr() have been defined to include the
    terminating '\0' when writing a string to a file.  This can be done
    at present with a sequence of instructions like:

	fputs(f, "Landon"); fputc(f, 0);
	fputs(f, "Curt"); fputc(f, 0);
	fputs(f, "Noll"); fputc(f, 0);

	One may now do:

	    fputstr(f, "Landon", "Curt", "Noll");

	and read them back by:

	    rewind(f);
	    x = fgetstr(f);	/* returns "Landon" */
	    y = fgetstr(f);	/* returns "Curt" */
	    z = fgetstr(f);	/* returns "Noll" */

    The builtin fgetfield() returns the next field of non-whitespace
    characters.

    The builtins scan(), fscan(), strscan() read tokens (fields of
    non-whitespace characters) and evaluates them.  Thus:

	global a,b,c;
	strscan("2+3  4^2\n c=a+b", a, b, 0);

	results in a = 5, b = 16, c = 21

    The functions scanf, fscanf, strscanf behave like the C functions
    scanf, fscanf, sscanf.   The conversion specifiers recognized are "%c",
    "%s", "%[...]" as in C, with the options of *, width-specification,
    and complementation (as in [^abc]), and "%n" for file-position, and
    "%f", "%r", "%e", "%i" for numbers or simple number-expressions - any
    width-specification is ignored; the expressions are not to include any
    white space or characters other than decimal digits, +, -, *, /, e, and i.
    E.g. expressions like 2e4i+7/8 are acceptable.

    The builtin size(x) now returns the size of x if x is an open file
    or -1 if x is a file but not open.	If s is a string, size(s) returns
    characters in s.

    Added builtin access("foo", "w") returns the null value if a file
    "foo" exists and is writable.

    Some systems has a libc symbolic qadd() that conflicted with calc's
    qadd function.  To avoid this, qadd() has been renamed to qqadd().

    The calc error codes are produced from the calcerr.tbl file.
    Instead of changing #defines in value.h, one can not edit calcerr.tbl.
    The Makefile builds calcerr.h from this file.

    Calc error codes are now as follows:

	<0			invalid
	0 .. sys_nerr-1		system error ala C's errno values
	sys_nerr .. E__BASE-1	reserved for future system errors
	E__BASE .. E__HIGHEST	calc internal errors
	E__HIGHEST+1 .. E_USERDEF-1	invalid
	E_USERDEF ..		user defined errors

    Currently, E__BASE == 10000 and E_USERDEF == 20000.	 Of course,
    sys_nerr is system defined however is likely to be < E__BASE.

    Renamed CONST_TYPE (as defined in have_const.h) to just CONST.
    This symbol will either be 'const' or an empty string depending
    on if your compiler understands const.

    CONST is beginning to be used with read-only tables and some
    function arguments.	 This allows certain compilers to better
    optimize the code as well as alerts one to when some value
    is being changed inappropriately.  Use of CONST as in:

	int foo(CONST int curds, char *CONST whey)

    while legal C is not as useful because the caller is protected
    by the fact that args are passed by value.	However, the
    in the following:

	int bar(CONST char *fizbin, CONST HALF *data)

    is useful because it calls the compiler that the string pointed
    at by 'fizbin' and the HALF array pointer at by 'data' should be
    treated as read-only.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.10.1t21 to 2.10.2t0:

    Bumped patch level 2.10.2t0 in honor of having help files for
    all builtin functions.  Beta release will happen at the end of
    the 2.10.2 cycle!!!

    Fewer items listed in BUGS due to a number of bug fixes.

    Less todo in the help/todo file because more has already been done.	 :-)

    All builtin functions have help files!  While a number need cleanup
    and some of the LIMITS, LIBRARY and SEE ALSO sections need fixing
    (or are missing), most of it is there.  A Big round of thanks goes to
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au> for his efforts in initial
    write-ups for many of these files!

    The recognition of '\' as an escape character in the format argument
    of printf() has been dropped.  Thus:

	printf("\\n");

    will print the two-character string "\n" rather than the a
    one-character carriage return.  <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    Missing args to printf-like functions will be treated as null values.

    The scope of of config("fullzero") has been extended to integers,
    so that for example, after config("mode","real"), config("display", 5),
    config("fullzero", 1), both:

	print 0, 1, 2;
	printf("%d %d %d\n", 0, 1, 2);

    print:

	.00000 1.00000, 2.00000

    The bug which caused calc to exit on:

	b = "print 27+"
	eval(b)

    has been fixed.  <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    Fixed bugs in zio.c which caused eval(str(x)) == x to fail
    in non-real modes such as "oct".  <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    The following:

	for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) print i^2,;

    now prints the same as:

	for (i = 1; i < 10; i++) print i^2,;

    The show globals will print '...' in the middle of large values.
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    The param(n) builtin, then n > 0, returns the address rather than
    the value of the n-th argument to save time and memory usage.  This
    is useful when a matrix with big number entries is passed as an arg.
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    The param(n) builtin, then n > 0, may be used as an lvalue:

	; define g() = (param(2) = param(1));
	; define h() = (param(1)++, param(2)--);
	; u = 5
	; v = 10
	; print g(u, &v), u, v;
	5 5 5
	; print h(&u, &v), u, v;
	5 6 4

    Missing args now evaluate to null as in:

	A = list(1,,3)
	B = list(,,)
	mat C[] = {,,}
	mat D[] = { }


The following are the changes from calc version 2.10.1t20 to 2.10.1t20:

    Changes made in preparation for Blum Blum Shub random number generator.

    REDC bug fixes: <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

	Fixed yet another bug in zdiv which occasionally caused the "top digit"
	of a nonzero quotient to be zero.

	Fixed a bug in zredcmul() where a rarely required "topdigit" is
	sometimes lost rather than added to the appropriate carry.

    A new function zredcmodinv(ZVALUE z, ZVALUE *res) has been defined
    for evaluating rp->inv in zredcalloc().  <ernie at turing dot une
    dot edu dot au>

    New functions zmod5(ZVALUE *zp) and zmod6(ZVALUE z, ZVALUE *res)
    have been defined to give O(N^1.585)-runtime evaluation of z % m
    for large N-word m.  These require m and BASE^(2*N) // m to have
    been stored at named locations lastmod, lastmodinv.  zmod5() is
    essentially for internal use by zmod6() and zpowermod().  <ernie at
    turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    Changes to rcmul(x,y,m) so that the result is always in [0, m-1].
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    Changes to some of the detail of zredcmul() so that it should run slightly
    faster.  Also changes to zredcsq() in the hope that it might achieve
    something like the improvement in speed of x^2 compared with x * x.
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    A new "bignum" algorithm for evaluating pmod(x,k,m) when
    N >= config("pow2").  For the multiplications and squaring
    modulo m, or their equivalent, when N >= config("redc2"),
    calc has used evaluations corresponding to rcout(x * y, m),
    for which the runtime is essentially that of three multiplications.
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    Yet more additions to the regress.cal test suite.

    Fixed some ANSI-C compile nits in shs.c and quickhash.c.

    Plugs some potential memory leaks in definitions in func.c.
    Expressions such as qlink(vals[2]) in some circumstances are
    neither qfreed nor returned as function values.
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    The nextcand() and prevcand() functions handle modval, modulus
    and skip by using ZVALUE rather than ZVALUE * and dropping
    the long modulus, etc.  <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    Changed a couple of occurrences of itoq(1) or itoq(0) to &_qone_
    and &_qzero_.  <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    In definition of f_primetest, changed ztolong(q2->num) to ztoi(q2->num)
    so that the sign of count in ptest(n, count, skip) is not lost; and
    ztolong(q3->num) to q3->num so that skip can be any integer.
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    In zprime.c, in definition of small_factor(), adds "&& *tp != 1" to
    the exit condition in the for loop so that searching for a factor
    will continue beyond the table of primes, as required for e.g.
    factor(2^59 - 1).  <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    Changed zprimetest() so that skip in ptest(n, count, skip)
    determines the way bases for the tests are selected.  Neg values of
    n are treated differently.	 When considering factorization,
    primeness, etc. one is concerned with equivalence classes which for
    the rational integers are {0}, {-1, 1}, {-2, 2}, etc.  To refer to
    an equivalence class users may use any of its elements but when
    returning a value for a factor the computer normally gives the
    non-negative member.  The same sort of thing happens with integers
    modulo an integer, with fractions, etc., etc.  E.g. users may refer
    to 3/4 as 6/8 or 9/12, etc.	 A simple summary of the way negative n
    is treated is "the sign is ignored". E.g. isprime(-97) and
    nextprime(-97) now return the same as isprime(97) and nextprime(97).
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>


The following are the changes from calc version 2.10.1t11 to 2.10.1t19:

    Added many more regression tests to lib/regress.cal.  Some
    due to <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>.

    Added many help files, most due to <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>.

    Fixed exp() and ln() so that when they return a complex value with
    a zero imaginary component, isreal() is true.  <ernie at turing dot
    une dot edu dot au>

    Fixed cast problem in byteswap.c.  <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    Fixed memory leak problem where repeated assignments did not
    free the previous value.  <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    Complex number ordering/comparison has been changed such that:

	a < b implies a + c < b + c
	a < b and c > 0 implies a * c < b * c
	a < b implies -a > -b

    To achieve a "natural" partial ordering of the complex numbers
    with the above properties, cmp(a,b) for real or complex numbers
    may be considered as follows:

	cmp(a,b) = sgn(re(a) - re(b)) + sgn(im(a) - im(b)) * 1i

    The cmp help file has been updated.

    Change HASH type to QCKHASH.  The HASH type is a name better suited
    for the upcoming one-way hash interface.

    Added the CONFIG type; a structure containing all of the configuration
    values under the control of config().  Added V_CONFIG data type.
    The call config("all") returns a V_CONFIG.	One may now save/restore
    the configuration state as follows:

	x = config("all")
	...
	config("all",x)

    Added two configuration aliases, "oldstd" (for old backward compatible
    standard configuration) and "newstd" (for new style configuration).
    One may set the historic configuration state by:

	config("all", "oldstd")

    One may use what some people consider to be a better but not backward
    compatible configuration state by:

	config("all", "newstd")

    Renamed config.h (configuration file built during the make) to conf.h.
    Added a new config.h to contain info on the V_CONFIG type.

    Fixed some ANSI C compile warnings.

    The show config output is not indented by only one tab, unless
    config("tab",0) in which case it is not indented.

    The order of show config has been changed to reflect the config
    type values.

    Changed declaration of sys_errlst in func.c to be char *.

    Added quo(x,y,rnd) and mod(x,y,rnd) to give function interfaces
    to // and % with rounding mode arguments.  Extended these functions
    to work for list-values, complex numbers and matrices.
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    For integer x, cfsim(x,8) returns 0.
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    Fixed config("leadzero").  <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    Set config("cfsim",8) by default (in "oldstd").  Setup initial idea for
    config("all", "newstd") to be the default with the following changes:

	display		10
	epsilon		1e-10
	quo		0
	outround	24
	leadzero	1
	fullzero	1
	prompt		"; "		(allows full line cut/paste)
	more		";; "		(allows full line cut/paste)

    The "newstd" is a (hopefully) more preferred configuration than the
    historic default.

    The fposval.h file defines DEV_BITS and INODE_BITS giving the
    bit size of the st_dev and st_ino stat elements.  Also added
    SWAP_HALF_IN_DEV and SWAP_HALF_IN_STSIZE.

    Added sec(), csc(), cot(), sech(), csch(), coth(), asec(), acsc(),
    acot(), asech(), acsch() and acoth() builtins. <ernie at turing dot
    une dot edu dot au>

    The initmasks() call is no longer needed.  The bitmask[] array
    is a compiled into zmath.c directly.

    Added isconfig(), ishash(), isrand() and israndom() builtins to
    test is something is a configuration state, hash state, RAND
    state or RANDOM state.

    The lib/cryrand.cal library now no longer keeps the Blum prime
    factors used to form he Blum modulus.  The default modulus has
    been expanded to 1062 bits product of two Blum primes.

    The function hash_init() is called to initialize the hash function
    interface.

    Misc calc man page fixes and new command line updates.

    Fixed bug related to srand(1).

    Cleaned up some warning messages.

    All calls to math_error() now have a /*NOTREACHED*/ comment after
    them.  This allows lint and compiler flow progs to note the jumpjmp
    nature of math_error().  Unfortunately some due to some systems
    not dealing with /*NOTREACHED*/ comments correctly, calls of the form:

	if (foo)
		math_error("bar");

    must be turned into:

	if (foo) {
		math_error("bar");
		/*NOTREACHED*/
	}

    The ploy() function can take a list of coefficients.  See the
    help/poly file.  Added poly.c.  <ernie at turing dot une dot edu
    dot au>

    Fixes and performance improvements to det().  <ernie at turing dot
    une dot edu dot au>

    Renamed atoq() and atoz() to str2q() and str2z() to avoid conflicts
    with libc function names.

    Fixed use of ${NROFF_ARG} when ${CATDIR} and ${NROFF} are set.

    Fixed SWAP_HALF_IN_B64 macro use for Big Endian machines without
    long long or with LONGLONG_BITS=0.

    Added error() and iserror() to generate a value of a given error type.
    See help/error for details.	 <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    Added singular forms of help files.	 For example one can now get
    help for binding, bug, change, errorcode and type.

    The builtin mmin(x, md) has been changed to return the same as
    mod(x, md, 16).  The old mmin(x, md) required md to be a positive
    integer and x to be an integer.  Now md can be any real number; x
    can be real, complex, or a matrix or list with real elements, etc.
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    The builtin avg(x_1, x_2, ...) has been changed to accept list-valued
    arguments:	a list x_i contributes its elements to the list of
    items to be averaged.  E.g. avg(list(1,2,list(3,4)),5) is treated
    as if it were avg(1,2,3,4,5).  If an error value is encountered in
    the items to be averaged, the first such value is returned.  If the
    number of items to be averaged is zero, the null value is returned.
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    The builtin hmean(x_1, x_2, ...) has been changed to admit types
    other than real for x_1, x_2, ...; list arguments are treated in
    the same way as in avg().  <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    The builtin eval(str) has been changed so that when str has a
    syntax error, instead of call to math_error(), an error value is
    returned.  <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    The old frem(x,y) builtin returned the wrong value when y was a power of
    2 greater than 2, e.g. f(8,4) is returned as 4 when its value should be 2.
    This has been fixed by a small change to the definition of zfacrem().
    Calc used to accept with no warning or error message, gcdrem(0,2) or
    generally gcdrem(0,y) for any y with abs(y) > 1, but then went into an
    infinite loop.  This has been fixed by never calling zfacrem() with zero x.
    Both frem(x,y) and gcdrem(x,y) now reject y = -1, 0 or 1 as errors.	 For
    nonzero x, and y == -1 or 1, defining frem(x,y) and gcdrem(x,y) to equal
    abs(x) is almost as natural as defining x^0 to be 1.  Similarly, if x is
    not zero then gcdrem(x,0) == 1.  <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>

    Plugged some more memory leaks.

    Fixed bug related randbit(x) skip (where x < 0).

    Added seedrandom.cal to help users use the raw random() interface well.

    Made extensive additions and changes to the rand() and random() generator
    comments in zrand.c.

    Fixed a bug in fposval.c that prevented calc from compiling on systems
    with 16 bit device and/or inodes.  Fixed error messages in fposval.c.

    Fixed bug that would put calc into an infinite loop if it is ran
    with errors in startup files (calc/startup, .calcrc).
    Ha Lam <hl at kuhep5 dot phsx dot ukans dot edu>


The following are the changes from calc version 2.10.0t13 to 2.10.1t10:

    Added SB8, USB8, SB16, USB16, SB32, USB32 typedefs, determined by
    longbits and declared in longbits.h, to deal with 8, 16 and 32 bit
    signed and unsigned values.

    The longbits.h will define HAVE_B64 with a 64 bit type (long or
    longlong) is available.   If one is, then SB64 and US64 typedefs
    are declared.

    The U(x) and L(x) macros only used to define 33 to 64 bit signed
    and unsigned constants.  Without HAVE_B64, these macros cannot
    be used.

    Changed the way zmath.h declares types such as HALF and FULL.

    Changed the PRINT typedef.

    The only place where the long long type might be used is in longlong.c
    and if HAVE_LONGLONG, in longbits.h if it is needed.  The only place
    were a long long constant might be used is in longlong.c.  Any
    long long constants, if HAVE_LONGLONG, are hidden under the U(x) and
    L(x) macros on longbits.h.	And of course, if you don't have long long,
    then HAVE_LONGLONG will NOT be defined and long long's will not be used.

    The longlong.h file is no longer directly used by the main calc source.
    It only comes into play when compiling the longbits tool.

    Added config("prompt") to change the default interactive prompt ("> ")
    and config("more") to change the default continuation prompt (">> ").

    Makefile builds align32.h with determines if 32 bit values must always
    be aligned on 32 bit boundaries.

    The CALCBINDINGS file is searched for along the CALCPATH.  The Makefile
    defines the default CALCBINDINGS is "bindings" (or "altbind") which
    is now usually found in ./lib or ${LIBDIR}.

    Per Ernest Bowen <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>, an optional
    third argument was added  sqrt() so that in sqrt(x,y,z), y and z have
    essentially the same role as in appr(x,y,z) except that of course
    what is being approximated is the sqrt of x.  Another difference is
    that two more bits of z are used in sqrt: bit 5 gives the option of
    exact results when they exist (the value of y is then ignored) and
    bit 6 returns the non-principal root rather than the principal value.

    If commands are given on the command line, leading tabs are not
    printed in output.	Giving a command on the command line implies
    that config("tab",0) was given.

    Pipe processing is enabled by use of -p.  For example:

	echo "print 2^21701-1, 2^23209-1" | calc -p | fizzbin

    In pipe mode, calc does not prompt, does not print leading tabs
    and does not print the initial version header.

    Calc will now form FILE objects for any open file descriptor > 2
    and < MAXFILES.  Calc assumes they are available for reading
    and writing.  For example:

	$ echo "A line of text in the file on descriptor 5" > datafile
	$ calc 5<datafile
	C-style arbitrary precision calculator (version 2.10.1t3)
	[Type "exit" to exit, or "help" for help.]

	; files(5)
		FILE 5 "descriptor[5]" (unknown_mode, pos 0)
	; fgetline(files(5))
		"A line of text in the file on descriptor 5"

    The -m mode flag now controls calc's ability to open files
    and execute programs.  This mode flag is a single digit that
    is processed in a similar way as the octal chmod values:

	0   do not open any file, do not execute progs
	1   do not open any file
	2   do not open files for reading, do not execute progs
	3   do not open files for reading
	4   do not open files for writing, do not execute progs
	5   do not open files for writing
	6   do not execute any program
	7   allow everything (default mode)

    Thus if one wished to run calc from a privileged user, one might
    want to use -m 0 in an effort to make calc more secure.

    The -m flags for reading and writing apply on open.
    Files already open are not effected.  Thus if one wanted to use
    the -m 0 in an effort to make calc more secure, but still be
    able to read and write a specific file, one might do:

	calc -m 0 3<a.file 4>b.file

	NOTE: Files presented to calc in this way are opened in an unknown
	      mode.  Calc will try to read or write them if directed.

    The maximum command line size it MAXCMD (16384) bytes.  Calc objects to
    command lines that are longer.

    The -u flag cause calc to un-buffer stdin and stdout.

    Added more help files.  Improved other help files.

    Removed trailing blanks from files.

    Removed or rewrite the formally gross and disgusting hacks for
    dealing with various sizes and byte sex FILEPOS and off_t types.

    Defined ilog2(x), ilog10(x), ilog(x,y) so that sign of x is ignored,
    e.g. ilog2(x) = ilog2(abs(x)).

    The sixth bit of rnd in config("round", rnd) and config("bround", rnd)
    is used to specify rounding to the given number of significant
    digits or bits rather than places, e.g. round(.00238, 2, 32)
    returns .0023, round(.00238, 2, 56) returns .0024.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.9.3t11 to 2.10.0t12:

    The default ${LIBDIR}/bindings CALCBINDINGS uses ^D for editing.
    The alternate CALCBINDINGS ${LIBDIR}/altbind uses ^D for EOF.

    The Makefile CC flag system has been changed.  The new CC flag system
    includes:

	CCMAIN are flags for ${CC} when compiling only files with main()
	CCOPT are flags given to ${CC} for optimization
	CCWARN are flags given to ${CC} for warning message control
	CCMISC are misc flags given to ${CC}

	CNOWARN are all flags given to ${CC} except ${CCWARN} flags
	CFLAGS are all flags given to ${CC}
	ICFLAGS are given to ${CC} for intermediate progs

	LCFLAGS are CC-style flags for ${LINT}
	LDFLAGS are flags given to ${CC} for linking .o files
	ILDFLAGS are given to ${CC} for linking .o's for intermediate progs

	CC is how the C compiler is invoked

    The syntax error:

	print a[3][[4]]

    used to send calc into a loop printing 'missing expression'.  This
    has been fixed.

    Added config("maxerr") and config("maxerr",val) to control the
    maximum number of errors before a computation is aborted.

    Removed regress.cal test #952 and #953 in case calc's stdout or
    stderr is re-directed to a non-file by some test suite.

    Changed how <stdarg.h>, <varags.h> or simulate stdarg is determined.
    Changed how vsprintf() vs sprintf() is determined.	The args.h file
    is created by Makefile to test which combination works.  Setting
    VARARG and/or HAVE_VSPRINTF in the Makefile will alter these tests
    and direct a specific combination to be used.  Removed have_vs.c,
    std_arg.h and try_stdarg.c.	 Added have_stdvs.c and have_varvs.c.

    Added 3rd optional arg to round(), bround(), appr() to specify the type of
    rounding to be used.

    Moved fnvhash.c to quickhash.c.

    Fixed a bug in appr rounding mode when >= 16.

    Added test2600.cal and test2700.cal. They are used by the regress.cal
    to provide a more extensive test suite for some builtin numeric
    functions.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.9.3t9.2+ to 2.9.3t10:

    Added many help files for builtin functions and some symbols.
    More help files are needed, see help/todo.

    Removed the calc malloc code.  Calc now uses malloc and free to
    manage storage since these implementations are often written to
    work best for the local system.  Removed CALC_MALLOC code and
    Makefile symbol.  Removed alloc.c.

    Added getenv("name"), putenv("name=val") and putenv("name, "val")
    builds for environment variable support thanks to "Dr." "D.J." Picton
    <dave at aps2 dot ph dot bham dot ac dot uk>.

    Added system("shell command") builtin to execute shell commands,
    thanks to "Dr." "D.J." Picton <dave at aps2 dot ph dot bham dot ac dot uk>.

    Added isatty(fd) builtin to determine if fd is attached to a tty
    thanks to "Dr." "D.J." Picton <dave at aps2 dot ph dot bham dot ac dot uk>.

    Added cmdbuf() builtin to return the command line executed by calc's
    command line args thanks to "Dr." "D.J." Picton <dave at aps2 dot
    ph dot bham dot ac dot uk>.

    Added strpos(str1,str2) builtin to determine the first position where
    str2 is found in str1 thanks to "Dr." "D.J." Picton
    <dave at aps2 dot ph dot bham dot ac dot uk>.

    Fixed bug that caused:

	global a,b,c		(newline with no semicolon)
	read test.cal

    the read command to not be recognized.

    The show command looks at only the first 4 chars of the argument so
    that:

	show globals
	show global
	show glob

    do the same thing.

    Added show config to print the config values and parameters thanks
    to Ernest Bowen <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>.

    Added show objtypes to print the defined objects thanks to Ernest Bowen
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>.

    Added more builtin function help files.

    Fixed the 3rd arg usage of the root builtin.

    Expanded the regress.cal regression test suite.

    Fixed -- and ++ with respect to objects and assignment (see the 2300
    series in regress.cal).

    Added isident(m) to determine if m is an identity matrix.

    The append(), insert() and push() builtins can now append between
    1 to 100 values to a list.

    Added reverse() and join() builtins to reverse and join lists
    thanks to Ernest Bowen <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>.

    Added sort() builtin to sort lists thanks to Ernest Bowen
    <ernie at turing dot une dot edu dot au>.

    Added head(), segment() and tail() builtins to return the head,
    middle or tail of lists thanks to Ernest Bowen <ernie at turing dot
    une dot edu dot au>.

    Added more and fixed some help files.

    The builtin help file is generated by the help makefile.  Thus it will
    reflect the actual calc builtin list instead of the last time someone
    tried to update it correctly.  :-)

    Fixed non-standard void pointer usage.

    Fixed base() bug with regards to the default base.

    Renamed MATH_PROTO() and HIST_PROTO() to PROTO().  Moved PROTO()
    into prototype.h.

    Fixed many function prototypes.  Calc does not declare functions
    as static in one place and extern in another.  Where reasonable
    function prototypes were added.  Several arg mismatch problems
    were fixed.

    Added support for SGI MIPSpro C compiler.

    Changes the order that args are declared to match the order
    of the function.  Some source tools got confused when:
    arg order did not match as in:

	void
	funct(foo,bar)
		int bar;	/* this caused a problem */
		char *foo;	/* even though it should not! */
	{
	}


The following are the changes from calc version 2.9.3t8 to 2.9.3t9.2:

    Use of the macro zisleone(z) has been clarified.  The zisleone(z) macro
    tests if z <= 1.  The macro zisabsleone(z) tests of z is 1, 0 or -1.
    Added zislezero(z) macro.  Bugs are related to this confusion have
    been fixed.

    Added zge64b(z) macro to zmath.h.

    Added the macro zgtmaxufull(z) to determine if z will fit into a FULL.
    Added the macro zgtmaxlong(z) to determine if z will fit into a long.
    Added the macro zgtmaxulong(z) to determine if z will fit into a unsigned
    long.

    Added the macro ztoulong(z) to convert an absolute value of a ZVALUE to
    an unsigned long, or to convert the low order bits of a ZVALUE.
    Added the macro ztolong(z) to convert an absolute value of a ZVALUE to
    an long, or to convert the low order bits of a ZVALUE.

    Some non-ANSI C compilers define __STDC__ to be 0, whereas all ANSI
    C compiles define it as non-zero.  Code that depends on ANSI C now
    uses #if defined(__STDC__) && __STDC__ != 0.

    Fixed ptest(a,b) bug where (a mod 2^32) < b.  Previously ptest()
    incorrectly returned 1 in certain cases.

    The second ptest() argument, which is now optional, defaults to 1.
    This ptest(x) is the same as ptest(x,1).

    Added an optional 3rd argument to ptest().	The 3rd arg tells how many
    tests to skip.  Thus ptest(a,10) performs the same probabilistic
    tests as ptest(a,3) and ptest(a,7,3).

    The ptest() builtin by default will determine if a value is divisible
    by a trivial prime.	 Thus, ptest(a,0) will only perform a quick trivial
    factor check.  If the test count is < 0, then this trivial factor check
    is omitted.	 Thus ptest(a,10) performs the same amount of work as
    ptest(a,3) and ptest(a,-7,3) and the same amount of work as
    ptest(a,-3) and ptest(a,7,3).

    Added nextcand(a[,b[,c]]) and prevcand(a[,b[,c]]) to search for the
    next/previous value v > a (or v < a) that passes ptest(v[,b[,c]]).
    The nextcand() and prevcand() builtins take the same arguments
    as ptest().

    Added nextprime(x) and and prevprime(x) return the next and
    previous primes with respect to x respectively.  As of this
    release, x must be < 2^32.	With one argument, they will return
    an error if x is out of range.  With two arguments, they will
    not generate an error but instead will return y.

    Fixed some memory leaks, particularly those related with pmod().

    Fixed some of the array bounds reference problems in domult().

    Added a hack-a-round fix for the uninitialized memory reference
    problems in zsquare/dosquare.

    The LIBRARY file has been updated to include a note about calling
    zio_init() first.  Also some additional useful macros have been noted.

    The lfactor() function returns -1 when given a negative value.
    It will not search for factors beyond 2^32 or 203280221 primes.
    Performance of lfactor() has been improved.

    Added factor(x,y) to look for the smallest factor < min(sqrt(x),y).

    Added libcalcerr.a for a math_error() routine for the convince of
    progs that make use of libcalc.a.  This routine by default will
    print an message on stderr and exit.  It can also be made to
    longjump instead.  See the file LIBRARY under ERROR HANDING.

    Added isprime() to test if a value is prime.  As of this release,
    isprime() is limited to values < 2^32.  With one argument,
    isprime(x) will return an error if x is out of range.  With
    two arguments, isprime(x,y) will not generate an error but
    instead will return y.

    Added pix(x) to return the number of primes <= x.  As of this
    release, x must be < 2^32.	With one argument, pix(x) will
    return an error if x is out of range.  With two arguments,
    pix(x,y) will not generate an error but instead will return y.

    Fixed the way *.h files are formed.	 Each file guards against
    multiple inclusion.

    Fixed numeric I/O on 64 bit systems.  Previously the print and
    constant conversion routines assumed a base of 2^16.

    Added support for 'long long' type.	 If the Makefile is setup
    with 'LONGLONG_BITS=', then it will attempt to detect support
    for the 'long long' type.  If the Makefile is setup with
    'LONGLONG_BITS=64', then a 64 bit 'long long' is assumed.
    Currently, only 64 bit 'long long' type is supported.
    Use of 'long long' allows one to double the size of the
    internal base, making a number of computations much faster.
    If the Makefile is setup with 'LONGLONG_BITS=0', then the
    'long long' type will not be used, even if the compiler
    supports it.

    Fixed avg() so that it will correctly handle matrix arguments.

    Fixed btrunc() limit.

    The ord("string") function can now take a string of multiple
    characters.	 However it still will only operate on the first
    character.

    Renamed stdarg.h to std_arg.h and endian.h endian_calc.h to
    avoid name conflicts with /usr/include on some systems that
    have make utilities that are too smart for their own good.

    Added additive 55 shuffle generator functions rand(), randbits()
    and its seed function srand().  Calling rand(a,b) produces a
    random value over the open half interval [a,b).  With one arg,
    rand(a) is equivalent to rand(0,a).	 Calling rand() produces
    64 random bits and is equivalent to rand(0,2^64).

    Calling randbit(x>0) produces x random bits.  Calling randbit(skip<0)
    skips -skip bits and returns -skip.

    The srand() function will return the current state.	 The call
    srand(0) returns the initial state.	 Calling srand(x), where
    x > 0 will seed the generator to a different state.	 Calling
    srand(mat55) (mat55 is a matrix of integers at least 55 elements long)
    will seed the internal table with the matrix elements mod 2^64.
    Finally calling srand(state) where state is a generator state
    also sets/seeds the generator.

    The cryrand.cal library has been modified to use the builtin
    rand() number generator.  The output of this generator is
    different from previous versions of this generator because
    the rand() builtin does not match the additive 55 / shuffle
    generators from the old cryrand.cal file.

    Added Makefile support for building BSD/386 releases.

    The cmp() builtin can now compare complex values.

    Added the errno() builtin to return the meaning of errno numbers.

    Added fputc(), fputs(), fgets(), ftell(), fseek() builtins.

    Added fsize() builtin to determine the size of an open file.

    Supports systems where file positions and offsets are longer than 2^32
    byte, longer than long and/or are not a simple type.

    When a file file is printed, the file number is also printed:

	FILE 3 "/etc/motd" (reading, pos 127)

    Added matsum() to sum all numeric values in a matrix.

    The following code now works, thanks to a fix by <ernie at turing
    dot une dot edu dot au> (Ernest Bowen):

		mat A[3] = {1, 2, 3};
		A[0] = A;
		print A[0];

    Also thanks to ernie, calc can process compound expressions
    such as 1 ? 2 ? 3 : 4 : 5.

    Also^2 thanks to ernie, the = operator is more general:

		(a = 3) = 4		(same as a = 3; a = 4)
		(a += 3) *= 4		(same as a += 3; a *= 4)
		matfill(B = A, 4)	(same as B = A; matfill(B, 4);)

    Also^3 thanks to ernie, the ++ and -- operators are more general.

		a = 3
		++(b = a)		(a == 3, b == 4)
		++++a			(a == 5)
		(++a)++ == 6		(a == 7)
		(++a) *= b		(a == 32, b == 4)

    Fixed a bug related to calling epsilon(variable) thanks to ernie.

    Removed trailing whitespace from source and help files.

    Some compilers do not support the const type.  The file have_const.h,
    which is built from have_const.c will determine if we can or should
    use const.	See the Makefile for details.

    Some systems do not have uid_t.  The file have_uid_t.h, which
    is built from have_uid_t.c will determine if we can or should
    depend on uid_t being typedefed by the system include files.
    See the Makefile for details.

    Some systems do not have memcpy(), memset() and strchr().  The
    file have_newstr.h, which is built from have_newstr.c will
    determine if we can or should depend libc providing these
    functions.	See the Makefile for details.

    The Makefile symbol DONT_HAVE_VSPRINTF is now called HAVE_VSPRINTF.
    The file have_vs.h, which is built from have_vs.c will determine if
    we can or should depend libc providing vsprintf().	See the Makefile
    for details.

    Removed UID_T and OLD_BSD symbols from the Makefile.

    A make all of the upper level Makefile will cause the all rule
    of the lib and help subdirs to be made as well.

    Fixed bug where reserved keyword used as symbol name caused a core dump.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.9.3t7 to 2.9.3t7:

    The 'show' command by itself will issue an error message
    that will remind one of the possible show arguments.
    (thanks to Ha S. Lam <hl at kuhep4 dot phsx dot ukans dot edu>)

    Fixed an ANSI-C related problem with the use of stringindex()
    by the show command.  ANSI-C interprets "bar\0foo..." as if
    it were "bar\017oo...".

    Added a cd command to change the current directory.
    (thanks to Ha S. Lam <hl at kuhep4 dot phsx dot ukans dot edu>)

    Calc will not output the initial version string, startup
    message and command prompt if stdin is not a tty.  Thus
    the shell command:

	echo "fact(100)" | calc

    only prints the result.  (thanks to Ha S. Lam <hl at kuhep4 dot phsx
    dot ukans dot edu>)

    The zmath.h macro zisbig() macro was replaced with zlt16b(),
    zge24b(), zge31b(), zge32b() and zgtmaxfull() which are
    independent of word size.

    The 'too large' limit for factorial operations (e.g., fact, pfact,
    lcmfact, perm and comb) is now 2^24.  Previously it depended on the
    word size which in the case of 64 bit systems was way too large.

    The 'too large' limit for exponentiation, bit position (isset,
    digit, ), matrix operations (size, index, creation), scaling,
    shifting, rounding and computing a Fibonacci number is 2^31.
    For example, one cannot raise a number by a power >= 2^31.
    One cannot test for a bit position >= 2^31.	 One cannot round
    a value to 2^31 decimal digit places.  One cannot compute
    the Fibonacci number F(2^31).

    Andy Fingerhut <jaf at dworkin dot wustl dot edu> (thanks!) supplied
    a fix to a subtle bug in the code generation routines.  The basic
    problem was that addop() is sometimes used to add a label to
    the opcode table of a function.  The addop() function did some
    optimization tricks, and if one of these labels happens to be an
    opcode that triggers optimization, incorrect opcodes were generated.

    Added utoz(), ztou() to zmath.c, and utoq(), qtou() to qmath.c
    in preparation for 2.9.3t9 mods.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.9.2 to 2.9.3t7:

    Calc can now compile on OSF/1, SGI and IBM RS6000 systems.

    A number of systems that have both <varargs.h> and <stdarg.h> do
    not correctly implement both types.	 On some System V, MIPS and DEC
    systems, vsprintf() and <stdarg.h> do not mix.  While calc will
    pass the regression test, use of undefined variables will cause
    problems.  The Makefile has been modified to look for this problem
    and work around it.

    Added randmprime.cal which find a prime of the form h*2^n-1 >= 2^x
    for some given x.  The initial search points for 'h' and 'n'
    are selected by a cryptographic pseudo-random generator.

    The library script nextprim.cal is now a link to nextprime.cal.
    The lib/Makefile will take care of this link and install.

    The show command now takes singular forms.	For example, the
    command 'show builtin' does the same as 'show builtins'.  This
    allows show to match the historic singular names used in
    the help system.

    Synced 'show builtin' output with 'help builtin' output.

    Fixed the ilog2() builtin.	Previously ilog2(2^-20) returned
    -21 instead of -20.

    The internal function qprecision() has been fixed.	The changes
    ensure that for any e for which 0 < e <= 1:

	1/4 < sup(abs(appr(x,e) - x))/e	 <= 1/2.

    Here 'sup' denotes the least upper bound over values of x (supremum).
    Previously calc did: 1/4 <= sup(abs(appr(x,e) - x))/e  < 1.

    Certain 64 bit processors such as the Alpha are now supported.

    Added -once to the READ command.  The command:

	read -once filename

    like the regular READ expect that it will ignore filename if
    is has been previously read.

    Improved the makefile.  One now can select the compiler type.  The
    make dependency lines are now simple foo.o: bar.h lines.  While
    this makes for a longer list, it is easier to maintain and will
    make future Makefile patches smaller.  Added special options for
    gcc version 1 & 2, and for cc on RS6000 systems.

    Calc compiles cleanly under the watchful eye of gcc version 2.4.5
    with the exception of warnings about 'aggregate has a partly
    bracketed initializer'.  (gcc v2 should allow you to disable
    this type of warning with using -Wall)

    Fixed a longjmp bug that clobbered a local variable in main().

    Fixed a number of cases where local variables or malloced storage was
    being used before being set.

    Fixed a number of fence post errors resulting in reads or writes
    just outside of malloced storage.

    A certain parallel processor optimizer would give up on
    code in cases where math_error() was called.  The obscure
    work-a-rounds involved initializing or making static, certain
    local variables.

    The cryrand.cal library has been improved.	Due to the way
    the initial quadratic residues are selected, the random numbers
    produced differ from previous versions.

    The printing of a leading '~' on rounded values is now a config
    option.  By default, tilde is still printed.  See help/config for
    details.

    The builtin function base() may be used to set the output mode or
    base.  Calling base(16) is a convenient shorthand for typing
    config("mode","hex").  See help/builtin.

    The printing of a leading tab is now a config option.  This does not
    alter the format of functions such as print or printf.  By default,
    a tab is printed.  See help/config for details.

    The value atan2(0,0) now returns 0 value in conformance with
    the 4.3BSD ANSI/IEEE 754-1985 math library.

    For all values of x, x^0 yields 1.	The major change here is
    that 0^0 yields 1 instead of an error.

    Fixed gcd() bug that caused gcd(2,3,1/2) to ignore the 1/2 arg.

    Fixed ltol() rounding so that exact results are returned, similar
    to the way sqrt() and hypot() round, when they exist.

    Fixed a bug involving ilog2().

    Fixed quomod(a,b,c,d) to give correct value for d when a is between
    0 and -b.

    Fixed hmean() to perform the necessary multiplication by the number of
    arguments.

    The file help/full is now being built.

    The man page is not installed by default.  One may install either
    the man page source or the cat (formatted man) page.  See the
    Makefile for details.

    Added a quit binding.  The file lib/bindings2 shows how this new
    binding may be used.

    One can now do a 'make check' to run the calc regression test
    within in the source tree.

    The regression test code is now more extensive.

    Updated the help/todo list.	 A BUGS file was added.	 Volunteers are
    welcome to send in patches!


The following are the changes from calc version 2.9.1 to 2.9.1:

    Fixed floor() for values -1 < x < 0.

    Fixed ceil() for values -1 < x < 0.

    Fixed frac() for values < 0 so that int(x) + frac(x) == x.

    Fixed wild fetch bug in zdiv, zquo and zmod code.

    Fixed bug which caused regression test #719 to fail on some machines.

    Added more regression test code.


The following are the changes from calc version 2.9.0 to 2.9.0:

    A major bug was fixed in subtracting two numbers when the first
    number was zero.  The problem caused wrong answers and core dumps.


The following are the changes from calc version 1.27.0 to 2.8.0:

    Full prototypes have been provided for all C functions, and are used
    if calc is compiled with an ANSI compiler.

    Newly defined variables are now initialized to the value of zero instead
    of to the null value.  The elements of new objects are also initialized
    to the value of zero instead of null.

    The gcd, lcm, and ismult functions now work for fractional values.

    A major bug in the // division for fractions with a negative divisor
    was fixed.

    A major bug in the calculation of ln for small values was fixed.

    A major bug in the calculation of the ln and power functions for complex
    numbers was fixed.

    A major lack of precision for sin and tan for small values was fixed.

    A major lack of precision for complex square roots was fixed.

    The "static" keyword has been implemented for variables.  So permanent
    variables can be defined to have either file scope or function scope.

    Initialization of variables during their declaration are now allowed.
    This is most convenient for the initialization of static variables.

    The matrix definition statement can now be used within a declaration
    statement, to immediately define a variable as a matrix.

    Initializations of the elements of matrices are now allowed.  One-
    dimensional matrices may have implicit bounds when initialization is
    used.

    The obj definition statement can now be used within a declaration
    statement, to immediately define a variable as an object.

    Object definitions can be repeated as long as they are exactly the same
    as the previous definition.	 This allows the rereading of files which
    happen to define objects.

    The integer, rational, and complex routines have been made into a
    'libcalc.a' library so that they can be used in other programs besides
    the calculator.  The "math.h" include file has been split into three
    include files: "zmath.h", "qmath.h", and "cmath.h".

Following is a list of visible changes to calc from version 1.26.4 to 1.26.4:

    Added an assoc function to return a new type of value called an
    association.  Such values are indexed by one or more arbitrary values.
    They are stored in a hash table for quick access.

    Added a hash() function which accepts one or more values and returns
    a quickly calculated small non-negative hash value for those values.

Following is a list of visible changes to calc from version 1.26.2 to 1.26.4:

    Misc fixes to Makefiles.

    Misc lint fixes.

    Misc portability fixes.

    Misc typo and working fixes to comments, help files and the man page.

Following is a list of visible changes to calc from version 1.24.7 to 1.26.1:

    There is a new emacs-like command line editing and edit history
    feature.  The old history mechanism has been removed.  The key
    bindings for the new editing commands are slightly configurable
    since they are read in from an initialization file.	 This file is
    usually called /usr/lib/calc/bindings, but can be changed by the
    CALCBINDINGS environment variable.	All editing code is
    self-contained in the new files hist.c and hist.h, which can be
    easily extracted and used in other programs.

    Two new library files have been added: chrem.cal and cryrand.cal.
    The first of these solves the Chinese remainder problem for a set
    of modulo's and remainders.	The second of these implements several
    very good random number generators for large numbers.

    A small bug which allowed division by zero was fixed.

    A major bug in the mattrans function was fixed.

    A major bug in the acos function for negative arguments was fixed.

    A major bug in the strprintf function when objects were being printed
    was fixed.

    A small bug in the library file regress.cal was fixed.

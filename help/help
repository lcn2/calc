For example:

    help usage

will print the calc command usage information.	One can obtain calc help
without invoking any startup code by running calc as follows:

    calc -q help topic

where 'topic' is one of the topics listed above.

You can also ask for help on a particular builtin function name.  For example:

    help asinh
    help round

See:

    help builtin

for a list of builtin functions.

Some calc operators have their own help pages:

    help =
    help ->
    help *
    help .
    help %
    help //
    help #

If the -m mode disallows opening files for reading or execution of programs,
then the help facility will be disabled.  See:

    help usage

for details of the -m mode.

The help command is able to display installed help files for custom builtin
functions.  However, if the custom name is the same as a standard help
file, the standard help file will be displayed instead.	 The custom help
builtin should be used to directly access the custom help file.

For example, the custom help builtin has the same name as the standard
help file.  That is:

    help help

will print this file only.  However the custom help builtin will print
only the custom builtin help file:

    custom("help", "help");

will by-pass a standard help file and look for the custom version directly.

As a hack, the following:

     help custhelp/anything

as the same effect as:

    custom("help", "anything");

The man command is an alias for the help command.  For example:

    man sin

Any help file that the help command is able to display may be
displayed by the man command.  The man command may only display
calc help files.

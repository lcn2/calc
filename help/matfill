NAME
    matfill - fill a matrix with specified value or values

SYNOPSIS
    matfill(m, x [, y])

TYPES
    m           matrix
    x           any
    y           any

    return      null

DESCRIPTION
    For any matrix m, matfill(m, x) assigns to every element of m the
    value x.  For a square matrix m, matfill(m, x, y) assigns the value
    x to the off-diagonal elements, y to the diagonal elements.

EXAMPLE
    ; mat A[3]; matfill(A, 2); print A
    mat [3] (3 elements, 3 nonzero):
        [0] = 2
        [1] = 2
        [2] = 2

    ; mat B[2, 1:2]; matfill(B,3,4); print B
    mat [2,1:2] (4 elements, 4 nonzero):
        [0,1] = 4
        [0,2] = 3
        [1,1] = 3
        [1,2] = 4

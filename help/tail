NAME
   tail - create a list of specified size from the tail of a list

SYNOPSIS
   tail(x, y)

TYPES
    x		list
    y		int

    return	list

DESCRIPTION
    If 0 <= y <= size(x) == n, tail(x,y) returns a list of size y whose
    elements in succession have values x[[n - y]]. x[[1]], ..., x[[n - 1]].

    If y > size(x), tail(x,y) is a copy of x.

    If -size(x) < y < 0, tail(x,y) returns a list of size (size(x) + y)
    whose elements in succession have values x[[-y]]. x[[-y + 1]], ...,
    x[[size(x) - 1]], i.e. a copy of x from which the first -y members
    have been deleted.

    If y <= -size(x), tail(x,y) returns a list with no members.

    For any integer y, x == join(head(x,-y), tail(x,y)).

EXAMPLE
    > A = list(2, 3, 5, 7, 11)
    > tail(A, 2)

    list (2 members, 2 nonzero):
	  [[0]] = 7
	  [[1]] = 11

    > tail(A, -2)

    list (3 members, 3 nonzero):
	  [[0]] = 5
	  [[1]] = 7
	  [[2]] = 11

LIMITS

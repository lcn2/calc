NAME
    lfactor - smallest prime factor in first specified number of primes

SYNOPSIS
    lfactor(n, m)

TYPES
    n		integer
    m		nonnegative integer <= 203280221 (= number of primes < 2^32)

    return	positive integer

DESCRIPTION
    This function ignores the signs of n and m, so here we shall
    assume n and limit are both nonnegative.

    If n is nonzero and abs(n) has a prime proper factor in the first
    m primes (2, 3, 5, ...), then lfactor(n, m) returns the smallest
    such factor.  Otherwise 1 is returned.

    If n is nonzero and m = pix(limit), then lfactor(n, m) returns the
    same as factor(n, limit).

    Both lfactor(n, 0) and lfactor(1, m) return 1 for all n and m.
    Also lfactor(0, m) always returns 1, and factor(0, limit) always
    returns 2 if limit >= 2.

EXAMPLE
    ; print lfactor(35,2), lfactor(35,3), lfactor(-35, 3)
    1 5 5

    ; print lfactor(2^32+1,115), lfactor(2^32+1,116), lfactor(2^59-1,1e5)
    1 641 179951

LIMITS
    m <= 203280221 (= number of primes < 2^32)

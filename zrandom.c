/*
 * AN OVERVIEW OF THE FUNCTIONS:
 *
 * This module contains a Blum-Blum-Shub generator:
 *
 *      To shorten the name, We refer to this generator as the Blum generator.
 *
 *      This generator is described in the papers:

 *          Blum, Blum, and Shub, "Comparison of Two Pseudorandom Number
 *          Generators", in Chaum, D. et. al., "Advances in Cryptology:

 *
 *      This generator is considered 'strong' in that it passes all
 *      polynomial-time statistical tests.  The sequences produced
 *      are random in an absolutely precise way.  There is absolutely
 *      no better way to predict the sequence than by tossing a coin
 *      (as with TRULY random numbers) EVEN IF YOU KNOW THE MODULUS!
 *      Furthermore, having a large chunk of output from the sequence
 *      does not help.  The BITS THAT FOLLOW OR PRECEDE A SEQUENCE
 *      ARE UNPREDICTABLE!
 *
 *      Of course the Blum modulus should have a long period.  The default
 *      Blum modulus as well as the compiled in Blum moduli have very long
 *      periods.  When using your own Blum modulus, a little care is needed
 *      to avoid generators with very short periods.  (see below)
 *
 *      To compromise the generator, an adversary must either factor the
 *      modulus or perform an exhaustive search just to determine the next
 *      (or previous) bit.  If we make the modulus hard to factor
 *      (such as the product of two large well chosen primes) breaking
 *      the sequence could be intractable for todays computers and methods.

 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * GOALS:
 *
 * The goals of this package are:
 *
 *      All magic numbers are explained:
 *
 *          I distrust systems with constants (magic numbers) and tables
 *          that have no justification.  I believe that I have
 *          done my best to justify all of the magic numbers used.
 *
 *      Full documentation:
 *
 *          You have this source file, plus background publications,
 *          what more could you ask?
 *
 *      Large selection of seeds:
 *
 *          Seeds are not limited to a small number of bits.  A seed
 *          may be of any size.
 *
 *      The strength of the generators may be tuned to meet the need:
 *
 *          By using the appropriate seed and other arguments, one may
 *          increase the strength of the generator to suit the need of
 *          the application.  One does not have just a few levels.
 *
 * Even though I have done my best to implement a good system, you still
 * must use these routines your own risk.

/*
 * ON THE GENERATOR:
 *
 * The Blum generator is the best generator in this package.  It
 * produces a cryptographically strong pseudo-random bit sequence.
 * Internally, a fixed number of bits are generated after each
 * generator iteration.  Any unused bits are saved for the next call
 * to the generator.  The Blum generator is not too slow, though
 * seeding the generator via srandom(seed,plen,qlen) can be slow.
 * Shortcuts and pre-defined generators have been provided for this reason.
 * Use of Blum should be more than acceptable for many applications.
 *
 * The Blum generator as the following calc interfaces:
 *
 *   random(min, beyond)                (where min < beyond)
 *
 *      Print a Blum generator random value over interval [min,beyond).
 *
 *      This form returns integers of the form:
 *
 *              min <= value < beyond
 *
 *   random()
 *
 *      Same as random(0, 2^64).  Print 64 bits.
 *
 *      This form returns integers of the form:
 *
 *              0 <= value < 2^64
 *
 *   random(lim)                (where lim > 0)
 *
 *      Same as random(0, lim).
 *
 *      This form returns integers of the form:
 *
 *              0 <= value < lim
 *
 *   randombit(x)               (where x > 0)
 *
 *      Same as random(0, 2^x).  Print x bits.
 *
 *      This form returns integers of the form:
 *
 *              0 <= value < 2^x
 *
 *   randombit(neg)             (where neg < 0)
 *
 *      Skip neg random bits and return the bit skip count.

/*
 * INITIALIZATION AND SEEDS:
 *
 * All generators come already seeded with precomputed initial constants.
 * Thus, it is not required to seed a generator before using it.
 *
 * The Blum generator may be initialized and seeded via srandom().
 *
 * Using a seed of '0' will reload generators with their initial states.
 *
 *      srandom(0)      restore Blum generator to the initial state
 *
 * The above single arg calls are fairly fast.
 *
 * The call:
 *
 *      srandom(seed, newn)
 *
 * is fast when the config value "srandom" is 0, 1 or 2.
 *
 * Optimal seed range for the Blum generator:
 *
 *      There is no limit on the size of a seed.  On the other hand,
 *      in most cases the seed is taken modulo the Blum modulus.
 *      Using a seed that is too small (except for 0) results in
 *      an internal generator be used to increase its size.
 *
 *      It is faster to use seeds that are in the half open internal
 *      [sqrt(n), n) where n is the Blum modulus.
 *
 *      The default Blum modulus is 260 bits long, so when using a the
 *      single arg call, a seed of between 128 and 256 bits is reasonable.
 *
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * srandom(seed)
 *
 *    We attempt to set the quadratic residue and possibly the Blum modulus.
 *
 *    Any internally buffered random bits are flushed.
 *
 *    The Blum modulus is only set if seed == 0.
 *
 *    The initial quadratic residue is set according to the seed
 *    arg as defined below.
 *
 *    seed >= 2^32:
 *    -------------
 *      Use seed to compute a new quadratic residue for use with
 *      the current Blum modulus.  We will successively square mod Blum
 *      modulus until we get a smaller value (modulus wrap).
 *
 *      The follow calc resource file produces an equivalent effect:
 *
 *        n = default_modulus;          (* n is the new Blum modulus *)
 *        r = seed;
 *        do {
 *            last_r = r;
 *            r = pmod(last_r, 2, n);
 *        } while (r > last_r);         (* r is the new quadratic residue *)
 *
 *      NOTE: The Blum modulus is not set by this call.
 *
 *    0 < seed < 2^32:
 *    ----------------
 *      Reserved for future use.
 *
 *    seed == 0:
 *    ----------
 *      Restore the initial state and modulus of the Blum generator.
 *      After this call, the Blum  generator is restored to its initial
 *      state after calc started.
 *
 *      The Blum prime factors of the modulus have been disclosed (see
 *      "SOURCE OF MAGIC NUMBERS" below).  If you want to use moduli that
 *      have not been disclosed, use srandom(seed, newn) with the
 *      appropriate args as noted below.
 *
 *      The follow calc resource file produces an equivalent effect:
 *
 *        n = default_modulus;  (* as used by the initial state *)
 *        r = default_residue;  (* as used by the initial state *)
 *
 *      NOTE: The Blum modulus is changed by this call.

 *      Set the Blum modulus to one of the pre-defined Blum moduli.

 *
 *      The follow calc resource file produces an equivalent effect:

 *        r = r[newn];          (* r is the new quadratic residue *)
 *
 *      The pre-defined Blum moduli was computed by searching for Blum
 *      primes (primes == 3 mod 4) starting from new values that
 *      were selected by LavaRnd, a hardware random number generator.
 *      See the URL:
 *
 *          http://www.LavaRnd.org/
 *
 *      for an explanation of how the LavaRnd random number generator works.
 *
 *      For a given newn, we select a given bit length.  For 0 < newn <= 20,
 *      the bit length selected was by:
 *
 *          bitlen = 2^(int((newn-1)/4)+7) + small_random_value;
 *
 *      where small_random_value is also generated by LavaRnd.   For
 *      1 <= newn <= 16, small_random_value is a random value in [0,40).
 *      For 17 < newn <= 20, small_random_value is a random value in [0,120).
 *      Given two random integers generated by LavaRnd, we used the following
 *      to compute Blum primes:
 *
 *        (* find the first Blum prime *)
 *        fp = int((ip-1)/2);           (* ip was generated by LavaRnd *)
 *        do {
 *            fp = nextcand(fp+2, 25, 0, 3, 4);
 *            p = 2*fp+1;
 *        } while (ptest(p, 25) == 0);
 *
 *        (* find the 2nd Blum prime *)
 *        fq = int((iq-1)/2);           (* iq was generated by LavaRnd *)
 *        do {
 *            fq = nextcand(fq+2, 25, 0, 3, 4);
 *            q = 2*fq+1;
 *        } while (ptest(q, 25) == 0);
 *
 *        (* compute the Blum modulus *)
 *        n[newn] = p * q;
 *
 *      The pre-defined quadratic residues was also generated by LavaRnd.
 *      The value produced by LavaRnd was squared mod the Blum moduli
 *      that was previously computed.
 *
 *      The purpose of these pre-defined Blum moduli is to provide users with
 *      an easy way to use a generator where the individual Blum primes used
 *      are not well known.  True, these values are in some way "MAGIC", on
 *      the other hand that is their purpose!  If this bothers you, don't
 *      use them.  See the section "FOR THE PARANOID" below for details.
 *
 *      The value 'newn' determines which pre-defined generator is used.
 *      For a given 'newn' the Blum modulus 'n[newn]' (product of 2 Blum
 *      (primes) and new quadratic residue 'r[newn]' is set as follows:

/*
 * TRUTH IN ADVERTISING:
 *
 * When the call:
 *
 *      srandom(seed, nextcand(ip,25,0,3,4)*nextcand(iq,25,0,3,4))
 *
 * probable primes from nextcand are used.  We use the word
 * 'probable' because of an extremely extremely small chance that a
 * composite (a non-prime) may be returned.
 *
 * We use the builtin function nextcand in its 5 arg form:
 *
 *      nextcand(value, 25, 0, 3, 4)
 *
 * The odds that a number returned by the above call is not prime is
 * less than 1 in 4^25.  For our purposes, this is sufficient as the
 * chance of returning a composite is much smaller than the chance that
 * a hardware glitch will cause nextcand() to return a bogus result.
 *
 * Another "truth in advertising" issue is the use of the term
 * 'pseudo-random'.  All deterministic generators are pseudo random.
 * This is opposed to true random generators based on some special
 * physical device.
 *
 * Even though Blum generator is 'pseudo-random', there is no statistical
 * test, which runs in polynomial time, that can distinguish the Blum
 * generator from a truly random source.  See the comment under
 * the "Blum-Blum-Shub generator" section above.
 *
 * A final "truth in advertising" issue deals with how the magic numbers
 * found in this file were generated.  Detains can be found in the
 * various functions, while a overview can be found in the "SOURCE FOR
 * MAGIC NUMBERS" section below.
 */

/*
 * SOURCE OF MAGIC NUMBERS:
 *
 * When seeding the Blum generator, we disallow seeds < 2^32 in an
 * effort to avoid trivial seed values such as 0, 1 or other small values.
 * The 2^32 lower bound limit was also selected because it provides a
 * large reserved value space for special seeds.  Currently the
 * [1,2^32) seed range is reserved for future use.
 *
 ***
 *
 * When using the 2 arg srandom(seed, newn), we require newn > 2^32
 * to avoid trivial Blum moduli.  The 2^32 lower bound limit was also
 * selected because it provides a large reserved value space for special
 * moduli.  Currently the [21,2^32) newn range is reserved for future use.
 *
 * When using the 3 or 4 arg srandom(seed, ip, iq [, trials]) form,
 * we require ip>2^16 and ip>2^16.  This ensures that the resulting
 * Blum modulus is > 2^32.
 *
 ***
 *
 * Taking some care to select a good initial residue helps eliminate cheap
 * search attacks.  It is true that a subsequent residue could be one of the
 * residues that we would first avoid.  However such an occurrence will
 * happen after the generator is well underway and any such seed information
 * has been lost.
 *
 * In an effort to avoid trivial seed values, we force the seed arg
 * to srandom() to be > 2^32.  We then square this value mod the
 * Blum modulus until it is less than the previous value.  This ensures
 * that the previous seed value is large enough that its square is > Blum
 * modulus, and this the square mod Blum modulus is non-trivial.
 *
 ***
 *
 * The size of default Blum modulus 'n=p*q' was taken to be > 2^259, or
 * 260 bits (79 digits) long.  A modulus > 2^256 will generate 8 bits
 * per crank of the generator.  The period of this generator is long
 * enough to be reasonable, and the modulus is small enough to be fast.
 *
 * The default Blum modulus is not a secure modulus because it can
 * be factored with ease.  As if Feb 1997,  the upper reach of the
 * state of the art for factoring general numbers was around 2^512.
 * Clearly factoring a 260 bit number if well within the reach of even
 * a low life Pentium.
 *
 * The fact that the default modulus can be factored with ease is
 * not a drawback.  Afterall, if we are going to keep to the goal
 * of disclosing the source magic numbers, we need to disclose how
 * the Blum Modulus was produced ... including its factors.  Knowing
 * the facotrs of the Blum modulus does not reduce its quality,
 * only the ability for someone to determine where you are in the
 * sequence.  But heck, the default seed is well known anyway so
 * there is no real loss if the factors are also known.
 *
 ***
 *
 * The default Blum modulus is the product of two Blum probable primes
 * that were selected by the Rand Book of Random Numbers.  Using the '6% rule',
 * a default Blum modulus n=p*q > 2^256 would be satisfied if p were
 * 38 decimal digits and q were 42 decimal digits in length.  We restate
 * the sizes in decimal digits because the Rand Book of Random Numbers is a
 * book of decimal digits.  Using the first 38 rand digits as a
 * starting search point for 'p', and the next 42 digits for a starting
 * search point for 'q'.
 *
 *      (*
 *       * setup the search points (lines split for readability)
 *       *)
 *      ip = 10097325337652013586346735487680959091;
 *      iq = 173929274945375420480564894742962480524037;

 *              fp = nextcand(fp+2, 25, 0, 3, 4);
 *              p = 2*fp+1;
 *      } while (ptest(p, 25) == 0);
 *
 *      (*
 *       * find the 2nd Blum prime
 *       *)
 *      fq = int((iq-1)/2);
 *      do {
 *              fq = nextcand(fq+2, 25, 0, 3, 4);
 *              q = 2*fq+1;
 *      } while (ptest(q, 25) == 0);
 *
 * The above resource file produces the Blum probable primes and initial
 * quadratic residue (line wrapped for readability):
 *
 *          p= 0x798ac934c7a3318ad446190f3474e57
 *
 *          q= 0x1ff21d7e1dd7d5965e224d485d84c3ef44f
 *
 * These Blum primes were found after 1.81s of CPU time on a 195 Mhz IP28
 * R10000 version 2.5 processor.  The first Blum prime 'p' was 31716 higher
 * than the initial search value 'ip'.  The second Blum prime 'q' was 18762
 * higher than the initial starting 'iq'.
 *
 * The product of the two Blum primes results in a 260 bit Blum modulus of:
 *
 *      n = 0xf2ac1903156af9e373d78613ed0e8d30284f34b644a9027d9ba55a689d6be18d9
 *
 * The selection if the initial quadratic residue comes from the next
 * unused digits of the Rand Book of Random Numbers.  Now the two initial
 * search values 'ip' and 'iq' used above needed the first 38 digits and
 * the next 42 digits.  Thus we will skip the first 38+42=80 digits
 * and begin to build in initial search value for a quadratic residue (most
 * significant digit first) from the Rand Book of Numbers digits until we
 * have a value whose square mod n > 4th power mod n.  In other words, we
 * need to build ir up from new Rand Book of Random Numbers digits until
 * we find a value in which srandom(ir), for the Blum Modulus 'n' produces
 * an initial quadratic residue on the first loop.
 *
 * Clearly we need to find an ir that is > sqrt(n).  The first ir:
 *
 *      ir = 2063610402008229166508422689531964509303
 *
 * fails the single loop criteria.  So we add the next digit:
 *
 *      ir = 20636104020082291665084226895319645093032
 *
 * Here we find that:
 *
 *      pmod(ir,2,n) > pmod(pmod(ir,2,n),2,n)
 *
 * Thus, for the Blum modulus 'n', the method outlined for srandom(ir) yields
 * the initial quadratic residue of:
 *
 *    r = 0x748b6d882ff4b074e2f1e93a8627d626506c73ca5a62546c90f23fd7ed3e7b11e
 *
 ***
 *
 * In the above process of finding the Blum primes used in the default
 * Blum modulus, we selected primes of the form:
 *
 *      2*x + 1         x is also prime
 *
 * because Blum generators with modulus 'n=p*q' have a period:
 *
 *      lambda(n) = lcm(factors of p-1 & q-1)
 *
 * since 'p' and 'q' are both odd, 'p-1' and 'q-1' have 2 as
 * a factor.  The calc resource file above ensures that '(p-1)/2' and
 * '(q-1)/2' are probable prime, thus maximizing the period
 * of the default generator to:
 *
 *      lambda(n) = lcm(2,2,fp,fq) = 2*fp*fq = ~2*(p/2)*(q/2) = ~n/2
 *
 * The process above resulted in a default generator Blum modulus n > 2^259
 * with period of at least 2^258 bits.  To be exact, the period of the
 * default Blum generator is:
 *
 *          0x79560c818ab57cf1b9ebc309f68746881adc15e79c05e476f741e5f904b9beb1a
 *
 * which is approximately:
 *
 *         ~8.781 * 10^77
 *
 * This period is more than long enough for computationally tractable tasks.
 *
 ***
 *
 * The 20 builtin generators, on the other hand, were selected
 * with more care.  While the lower order 20 generators have
 * factorable generators, the higher order are likely to be
 * be beyond the reach for a while.
 *
 * The lengths of the two Blum probable primes 'p' and 'q' used to make up
 * the 20 Blum moduli 'n=p*q' differ slightly to avoid certain
 * factorization attacks that work on numbers that are a perfect square,
 * or where the two primes are nearly the same.  I elected to have the
 * sizes differ by up to 6% of the product size to avoid such attacks.
 * Clearly one does not want the size of the two factors to differ
 * by a large percentage: p=3 and q large would result in a easy
 * to factor Blum modulus.  Thus we select sizes that differ by
 * up to 6% but not (significantly) greater than 6%.
 *
 * Using the '6% rule' above, a Blum modulus n=p*q > 2^1024 would have two
 * Blum factors p > 2^482 and q > 2^542.  This is because 482+542 = 1024.
 * The difference 542-482 is ~5.86% of 1024, and is the largest difference
 * that is < 6%.
 *
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * FOR THE PARANOID:
 *
 * The truly paranoid might suggest that my claims in the MAGIC NUMBERS
 * section are a lie intended to entrap people.  Well they are not, but
 * you need not take my word for it.
 *
 ***
 *
 * One could take issue with the above resource file that produced a 260 bit
 * Blum modulus.  So if that bothers you, then seed your generator
 * with your own Blum modulus and initial quadratic residue.  And
 * if you are truly paranoid, why would you want to use the default seed,
 * which is well known?
 *
 ***
 *
 * If all the above fails to pacify the truly paranoid, then one may
 * select your own modulus and initial quadratic residue by calling:
 *
 *      srandom(r, n);
 *
 * Of course, you will need to select a correct Blum modulus 'n' as the
 * product of two Blum primes (both 3 mod 4) and with a long period (where
 * lcm(factors of one less than the two Blum primes) is large) and an
 * initial quadratic residue 'r' that is hard to guess selected at random.
 *
 * A simple way to seed the generator would be to:
 *
 *      srandom(ir, ip, iq, 25)
 *
 * where 'ip', 'iq' and 'ir' are large integers that are unlikely to be
 * 'guessed' and where numbers around the size of iq*ir are beyond
 * the current reach of the best factoring methods on the fastest
 * SGI/Cray supercomputers.
 *
 * Of course you can increase the '25' value if 1 of 4^25 odds of a
 * non-prime are too probable for you.
 *
 * The problem with the above call is that the period of the Blum generator
 * could be small if 'p' and 'q' have lots of small prime factors in common.
 *
 * A better way to do seed the Blum generator yourself is to use the
 * seedrandom(seed1, seed2, size [,tests]) function from "seedrandom.cal"
 * with the args:
 *
 *      seed1 - seed rand() to search for 'p', select from [2^64, 2^308)
 *      seed2 - seed rand() to search for 'q', select from [2^64, 2^308)
 *      size  - minimum bit size of the Blum modulus 'n=p*q'
 *      tests - optional arg for number of pseudo prime tests (default is 25)
 *
 * Last, one could use some external random source to select starting
 * search points for 'p', 'q' and the quadratic residue.  One way to
 * do this is:
 *
 *      fp = int((ip-1)/2);
 *      do {
 *          fp = nextcand(fp+2, tests, 0, 3, 4);
 *          p = 2*fp+1;
 *      } while (ptest(p, tests) == 0);
 *      fq = int((iq-1)/2);
 *      do {
 *          fq = nextcand(fq+2, tests, 0, 3, 4);
 *          q = 2*fq+1;
 *      } while (ptest(q, tests) == 0);
 *      srandom(pmod(ir,2,p*q), p*q);
 *
 * where 'tests' is the number of pseudo prime tests that a candidate must
 * pass before being considered a probable prime (must be >0, perhaps 25), and
 * where 'ip' is the initial search location for the Blum prime 'p', and
 * where 'iq' is the initial search location for the Blum prime 'q', and
 * where 'ir' is the initial Blum quadratic residue generator.  The 'ir'
 * value should be a random value in the range [2^(binsize*4/5), 2^(binsize-2))
 * where 2^(binsize-1) < n=p*q <= 2^binsize.
 *
 * Your external generator would need to generate 'ip', 'iq' and 'ir'.
 * While any value for 'ip' and 'iq will do (provided that their product
 * is large enough to meet your modulus needs), 'ir' should be selected
 * to avoid values near 0 or near 'n' (or ip*iq).
 *
 ***
 *
 * The Blum moduli used with the pre-defined generators (via the call
 * srandom(seed, 0<x<=16)) were generated using the above process.  The
 * 'ip', 'iq' and 'ir' values were produced by special purpose hardware
 * that produced cryptographically strong random numbers.  The Blum
 * primes used in these special pre-defined generators are unknown.
 *
 * Not being able to factor 'n=p*q' into 'p' and 'q' does not directly
 * improve the quality Blum generator.  On the other hand, it does
 * improve the security of it.
 *
 * I (Landon Curt Noll) did not keep the search values of these 20 special
 * pre-defined generators.  While some of the smaller Blum moduli is
 * within the range of some factoring methods, others are not.  As of
 * Feb 1997, the following is the estimate of what can factor the
 * pre-defined moduli:
 *
 *      1 <= newn < 4   PC using ECM in a short amount of time
 *      5 <= newn < 8   Workstation using MPQS in a short amount of time
 *      8 <= newn < 12  High end supercomputer or high parallel processor
 *                      using state of the art factoring over a long time
 *     12 <= newn < 16  Beyond Feb 1997 systems and factoring methods
 *     17 <= newn < 20  Well beyond Feb 1997 systems and factoring methods
 *
 * This is not to say that in the future things will not change.  One
 * can say that faster hardware will not help in the factoring of 1024+
 * bit Blum moduli found in 12 <= newn as well as in the default
 * Blum generator.  A combination of better algorithms, helped by faster
 * hardware will be needed.
 *
 * It is true that the pre-defined moduli are 'magic'.  On the other
 * hand, there purpose was in part to produce users with pre-seeded
 * generators where the individual Blum primes are not well known.  If
 * this bothers you, don't use them and seed your own!
 *
 ***
 *
 * The output of the Blum generator has been proven to be cryptographically
 * strong.  I.e., there is absolutely no better way to predict the next
 * bit in the sequence than by tossing a coin (as with TRULY random numbers)
 * EVEN IF YOU HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PREVIOUSLY GENERATED BITS AND KNOW
 * A LARGE NUMBER OF BITS THAT FOLLOW THE NEXT BIT!  An adversary would
 * be far better advised to try to factor the modulus or exhaustively search
 * for the quadratic residue in use.

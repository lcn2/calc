NAME
    hash - return the calc hash value

SYNOPSIS
    hash(x_1 [, x_2, x_3, ...])

TYPES
    x_1, x_1, ...       any

    return              integer v, 0 <= v < 2^32

DESCRIPTION
    Returns a hash value for one or more values of arbitrary types.

    The calc hash value is based on the core Fowler/Noll/Vo hash
    known as FNV-0.  The return value, however, cannot be used
    as an FNV hash value because calc's internal function also
    takes into account more abstract concepts such as data types.

    WARNING: Use of FNV-0 is NOT recommended for general purposes.
             Calc uses FNV-0 for internal objects such as associative
             arrays as well as other internal processes.  Calc
             maintains the use of FNV-0 for backwards compatibility.

             You should use the FNV-1a hash instead!!!!!

    Use the fnv() builtin function for general quick, non-cryptographic
    hash purposes.

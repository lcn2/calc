Calc Todo Items:

    Code contributions are welcome.  First Subscribe to the calc-tester
    mailing list.  Next, send patches to the calc-tester mailing list.

    To subscribe to the calc-tester mailing list, visit the following URL:

	    http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/calc/calc-tester.html

	This is a low volume moderated mailing list.

	This mailing list replaces calc-tester at asthe dot com list.

	If you need a human to help you with your mailing list subscription,
	please send EMail to our special:

	    calc-tester-maillist-help at asthe dot com

	    NOTE: Remove spaces and replace 'at' with @, 'dot' with .

	address.  To be sure we see your EMail asking for help with your
	mailing list subscription, please use the following phase in your
	EMail Subject line:

	    calc tester mailing list help

	That phrase in your subject line will help ensure your
	request will get past our anti-spam filters.  You may have
	additional words in your subject line.

High priority items:

    * Improve the way that calc parses statements such as if, for, while
      and do so that when a C programmer does.  This works as expected:

	    if (expr) {
		...
	    }

      However this WILL NOT WORK AS EXPECTED:

	    if (expr)
	    {
		...
	    }

      because calc will parse the if being terminated by
      an empty statement followed by a

	    if (expr) ;
	    {
		...
	    }

      See also "help statement", "help unexpected", "help todo", and
      "help bugs".

    * Consider using GNU autoconf / configure to build calc.

    * It is overkill to have nearly everything wind up in libcalc.
      Form a libcalcmath and a libcalclang so that an application
      that just wants to link with the calc math libs can use them
      without dragging in all of the other calc language, I/O,
      and builtin functions.

    * Fix any 'Known bugs' as noted in the BUGS file or as
      displayed by 'calc help bugs'.

=-=

Medium priority items:

    * Verify, complete or fix the 'SEE ALSO' help file sections.

    * Verify, complete or fix the 'LINK LIBRARY' help file sections.

    * Verify, complete or fix the 'LIMITS' help file sections.

    * Verify, complete or fix the 'SYNOPSIS' and 'TYPES' help file sections.

    * Perform a code coverage analysis of the 'make check' action
      and improve the coverage (within reason) of the regress.cal suite.

    * Address, if possible and reasonable, any Calc Mis-features
      as noted in the BUGS file or as displayed by 'calc help bugs'.

    * Internationalize calc by converting calc error messages and
      text strings (e.g., calc startup banner, show output, etc.)
      into calls to the GNU gettext internationalization facility.
      If somebody translated these strings into another language,
      setting $LANG would allow calc to produce error messages
      and text strings in that language.

=-=

Low priority items:

    * Complete the use of CONST where appropriate:

	CONST is beginning to be used with read-only tables and some
	function arguments.  This allows certain compilers to better
	optimize the code as well as alerts one to when some value
	is being changed inappropriately.  Use of CONST as in:

	    int foo(CONST int curds, char *CONST whey)

	while legal C is not as useful because the caller is protected
	by the fact that args are passed by value.  However, the
	in the following:

	    int bar(CONST char *fizbin, CONST HALF *data)

	is useful because it calls the compiler that the string pointed
	at by 'fizbin' and the HALF array pointer at by 'data' should be
	treated as read-only.

      One should make available a the fundamental math operations
      on ZVALUE, NUMBER and perhaps COMPLEX (without all of the
      other stuff) in a separate library.

    * Clean the source code and document it better.

    * Add a builtin function to access the 64 bit FNV hash which
      is currently being used internally in seed.c.

Calc bug reports and calc bug fixes should be sent to:

	calc-bug-report at asthe dot com

	NOTE: Remove spaces and replace 'at' with @, 'dot' with .

    This replaces the old calc-bugs at asthe dot com address.

    To be sure we see your EMail reporting a calc bug, please use the
    following phase in your EMail Subject line:

	calc bug report

    That phrase in your subject line will help ensure your
    request will get past our anti-spam filters.  You may have
    additional words in your subject line.

    However, you may find it more helpful to simply subscribe
    to the calc-tester mailing list (see above) and then to
    send your report to that mailing list as a wider set calc
    testers may be able to help you.

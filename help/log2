NAME
    log2 -  base 10 logarithm

SYNOPSIS
    log2(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x		nonzero real or complex
    eps		nonzero real, defaults to epsilon()

    return	real or complex

DESCRIPTION
    Approximate the base 2 logarithm function of x by a multiple of
    epsilon, the error having absolute value less than 0.75 * eps.

    If y is a positive integer, log(x, 2^-y) will usually be correct
    to the y-th decimal place.

    When x if a power of 2, log2(x) will return an integer regardless
    of the value of eps or epsilon().

EXAMPLE
    ; print log2(2), log2(4), log2(1024), log2(2^500)
    1 2 10 500

    ; print log(127), log(23209), log(2^17-19)
    ~6.98868468677216585326 ~14.50239674255407864468 ~16.99979085393743521984

    ; print log(2+3i, 1e-5)
    ~1.85020558320709803073+~1.41786049195700786266i

LIMITS
    x != 0
    eps > 0

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qlog2(NUMBER *x, NUMBER *eps)
    COMPLEX *c_log2(COMPLEX *x, NUMBER *eps)

NAME
    reverse - reverse a copy of a list or matrix

SYNOPSIS
    reverse(x)

TYPES
    x           list or matrix

    return      same type as x

DESCRIPTION
    For a list or matrix x, reverse(x) returns a list or matrix in
    which the order of the elements has been reversed.  The original
    list or matrix x is unchanged.

    In the case of matrix x, the returned value is a matrix with
    the same dimension and index limits, but the reversing is performed
    as if the matrix were a linear array.

EXAMPLE
    ; A = list(1, 7, 2, 4, 2)
    ; print reverse(A)

    list (5 elements, 5 nonzero):
          [[0]] = 2
          [[1]] = 4
          [[2]] = 2
          [[3]] = 7
          [[4]] = 1

    ; mat B[2,3] = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
    ; print reverse(B)

    mat [2,3] (6 elements, 6 nonzero):
      [0,0] = 6
      [0,1] = 5
      [0,2] = 4
      [1,0] = 3
      [1,1] = 2
      [1,2] = 1

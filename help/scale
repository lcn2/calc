NAME
    scale - scale a number or numbers in a value by a power of 2

SYNOPSIS
    scale(x, n)

TYPES
    If x is an xx-object, scale(x, n) requires xx_scale() to have been
    defined; conditions on x and n and the type of value returned are
    determined by the definition of xx_scale().

    For other x:

    x		number (real or complex) or matrix
    n		integer

    return	same type as x

DESCRIPTION
    Returns the value of 2^n * x.

    scale(x,n) returns the same as x << n and x >> -n if x is an integer
    for which 2^n * x is an integer.

EXAMPLE
    > print scale(3, 2), scale(3,1), scale(3,0), scale(3,-1), scale(3,-2)
    12 6 3 1.5 .75

LIMITS
    For non-object x, abs(n) < 2^31

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qscale(NUMBER *x, long n)
    COMPLEX *cscale(COMPLEX *x, long n)
    MATRIX *matscale(MATRIX *x, long n)

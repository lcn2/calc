NAME
    isptr - whether a value is a pointer

SYNOPSIS
    isptr(x)

TYPES
    x           any

    return      0, 1, 2, 3, or 4

DESCRIPTION
    isptr(x) returns:

                0 if x is a not pointer
                1 if x is an octet-pointer
                2 if x is a value-pointer
                3 if x is a string-pointer
                4 if x is a number-pointer

     Pointers are initially defined by using the address (&) operator
     with an "addressable" value; currently, these are octets, lvalues,
     strings and real numbers.

EXAMPLE
    ; a = "abc", b = 3, B = blk()
    ; p1 = &B[1]
    ; p2 = &a
    ; p3 = &*a
    ; p4 = &*b
    ; print isptr(a), isptr(p1), isptr(p2), isptr(p3), isptr(p4)
    0 1 2 3 4

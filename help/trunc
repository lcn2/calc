NAME
    trunc - truncate a value to a number of decimal places

SYNOPSIS
    trunc(x [,j])

TYPES
    x           real
    j           int

    return      real

DESCRIPTION
    Truncate x to j decimal places.  If j is omitted, 0 places is assumed.
    Specifying zero places makes the result identical to int().

    Truncation of a non-integer produces values nearer to zero.

EXAMPLE
    ; print trunc(pi()), trunc(pi(), 5)
    3 3.14159

    ; print trunc(3.333), trunc(3.789), trunc(3.333, 2), trunc(3.789, 2)
    3 3 3.33 3.78

    ; print trunc(-3.333), trunc(-3.789), trunc(-3.333, 2), trunc(-3.789, 2)
    -3 -3 -3.33 -3.78

LIMITS
    0 <= j < 2^31

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qtrunc(NUMBER *x, *j)

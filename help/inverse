NAME
    inverse - inverse of value

SYNOPSIS
    inverse(x)

TYPES
    If x is an object of type xx, the function xx_inv has to have
    been defined; any conditions on x and the nature of the returned
    value will depend on the definition of xx_inv.

    For non-object x:

    x           nonzero number (real or complex) or nonsingular matrix

    return      number or matrix

DESCRIPTION
    For real or complex x, inverse(x) returns the value of 1/x.

    If x is a nonsingular n x n matrix and its elements are numbers or
    objects for which the required arithmetic operations are defined,
    inverse(x) returns the matrix m for which m * x = x * m = the unit
    n x n matrix.  The inverse m will have the same index limits as x.

EXAMPLE
    ; print inverse(5/4), inverse(-2/7), inverse(3 + 4i)
    0.8 -3.5 0.12-0.16i

    ; mat A[2,2] = {2,3,5,7}
    ; print inverse(A)

    mat [2,2] (4 elements, 4 nonzero):
        [0,0] = -7
        [0,1] = 3
        [1,0] = 5
        [1,1] = -2

LIMITS
    none

LINK LIBRARY
    void invertvalue(VALUE *x, VALUE *vres)
    NUMBER *qinv(NUMBER *x)
    COMPLEX *c_inv(COMPLEX *x)
    MATRIX *matinv(MATRIX *x)

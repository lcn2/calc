NAME
    fgets - read the next line from a file, newline is kept

SYNOPSIS
    fgets(fd)

TYPES
    fd		file

    return	str or nil

DESCRIPTION
    This function reads the next line, including any trailing newline from
    the open file associated with fd.  Unlike fgetline, the trailing
    newline is included in the return string.

    If a line is read, it is returned, otherwise (EOF or ERROR) nil is returned.

EXAMPLE
    > fd = fopen("/tmp/newfile", "w")
    > fputs(fd, "chongo was here\n")
    > fd2 = fopen("/tmp/newfile", "r")
    > fgets(fd2)
	    "chongo was here
    "

    > fclose(fd2)
    > fd2 = fopen("/tmp/newfile", "r")
    > fgetline(fd2)
	    "chongo was here"

LIMITS
    fd must be associated with an open file

LINK LIBRARY
    none

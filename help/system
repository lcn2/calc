NAME
    system - issue a shell command

SYNOPSIS
    system(cmd)

TYPES
    cmd         str

    return      int

DESCRIPTION
    This function executes the shell command found in the string, cmd.
    The return value is system dependent.  On POSIX P1003.1 compliant
    systems the return value is defined by the waitpid system call.
    Typically a shell command that returns with a 0 exit status will
    cause this function to return a 0 value.  On some systems, a shell
    command that returns with an exit status of e will cause this
    function to return e*256.  Core dumps, termination due to signals
    and other waitpid values will change the return value.

    On POSIX P1003.1 compliant systems, if cmd is empty then this function
    will determine if the shell is executable.  If the shell is executable,
    0 is returned otherwise non-zero is returned.

EXAMPLE
    ; system("")
            0
    ; system("true")
            0
    ; system("exit 2")
            512
    ; system("date")

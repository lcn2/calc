NAME
    pmod - integral power of an integer modulo a specified integer

SYNOPSIS
    pmod(x, n, md)

TYPES
    x           integer
    n           nonnegative integer
    md          integer

    return      integer

DESCRIPTION
    pmod(x, n, md) returns the integer value of the canonical residue
    of x^n modulo md, where the set of canonical residues is determined
    by md and bits 0, 2, and 4 of config("mod") (other bits are ignored).

    If md is zero, the value is simply x^n.

    For nonzero md, the canonical residues v modulo md are as follows:

                config("mod")     md > 0              md < 0

                    0           0 < v < md         md < v < 0
                    1         -md < v < 0           0 < v < -md
                    4           0 < v < md          0 < v < -md
                    5         -md < v < 0          md < v < 0
                   16       -md/2 < v <= md/2   md/2 <= v < -md/2
                   17      -md/2 <= v < md/2     md/2 < v <= -md/2
                   20       -md/2 < v <= md/2    md/2 < v <= -md/2
                   21      -md/2 <= v < md/2    md/2 <= v < -md/2

EXAMPLE
    ; c = config("mod",0)
    ; print pmod(2,3,10), pmod(2,5,10), pmod(2,3,-10), pod(2,5,-10)
    8 2 -2 -8

    ; c = config("mod",16)
    ; print pmod(2,3,10), pmod(2,5,10), pmod(2,3,-10), pmod(2,5,-10)
    -2 2 -2 2

LIMITS
    none

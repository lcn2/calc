NAME
    d2dms - convert degrees into degrees, minutes, and seconds

SYNOPSIS
    d2dms(degs, d, m, s [,rnd])

TYPES
    degs	real
    d		null-or-real-valued lvalue with assign-to permission
    m		null-or-real-valued lvalue with assign-to permission
    s		null-or-real-valued lvalue with assign-to permission
    rnd		nonnegative integer, defaults to config("mod")

    return	mod(degs, 360, rnd)

DESCRIPTION
    Convert degs degrees into d degrees, m minutes, and s seconds.

    The return value is a normalized number of degrees, and is equivalent
    to the following:

	return_value = mod(degs, 360, rnd);

    The argument rnd, if not given, defaults to config("mod").
    For more information on the effects of rnd, see "help mod".

    Depending on the rounding mode, the return could be a real value
    in the interval [0, 360) or a real value in the interval (-360, 0].
    For the default round mode, the return value is in the interval [0, 360).

    The d argument will be an integer number of degrees.

    The value d will be set as if the following were used:

	d = int(return_value);

    For some rounding modes, d will be an integer in the interval [0, 360).
    For other rounding modes, d will be an integer in the interval (-360, 0].
    For the default round mode, d is in the interval [0, 360).

    The m argument will be an integer number of minutes.

    The value m will be set as if the following were used:

	tmp = return_value - d;
	tmp_m = tmp * 60;
	free(tmp);
	m = int(tmp_m);

    For some rounding modes, m will be an integer in the interval [0, 60).
    For other rounding modes, m will be an integer in the interval (-60, 0].
    For the default round mode, m will be in the interval [0, 60).

    The s argument will be a real number of seconds.

    The value s will be set as if the following were used:

	tmp = tmp_m - m;
	free(tmp_m);
	s = tmp * 60;
	free(tmp);

    For some rounding modes, s will be a real value in the interval [0, 60).
    For other rounding modes, s will be a real value in the interval (-60, 0].
    For the default round mode, s will be in the interval [0, 60).

    The following shows relationship between the return value and the resulting
    d, m, and s values:

	return_value == d + m/60 + s/3600;

EXAMPLE
    ; ## if args are undefined, pre-declare them or assign them as args

    ; global d, m, s;

    ; print d2dms(12.3456,d,m,s), d, m, s;
    12.3456 12 20 44.16
    ; print d2dms(1234.5678,d,m,s), d, m, s;
    154.5678 154 34 4.08
    ; print d2dms(-1234.5678,d,m,s), d, m, s;
    205.4322 205 25 55.92

    ; print d2dms(654.321,deg=,min=,sec=), deg, min, sec;
    294.321, 294, 19, 15.6
    ; print d2dms(-654.321,deg=,min=,sec=), deg, min, sec;
    65.679 65 40 44.4
    ; print d2dms(360.321,deg=,min=,sec=), deg, min, sec;
    0.321 0 19 15.6

    ; ## certain non-default rounding modes can return negative values

    ; print d2dms(654.321,deg=,min=,sec=,1), deg, min, sec;
    -65.679 -65 -40 -44.4
    ; print d2dms(-654.321,deg=,min=,sec=,1), deg, min, sec;
    -294.321 -294 -19 -15.6
    ; print d2dms(360.321,deg=,min=,sec=,1), deg, min, sec;
    -359.679 -359 -40 -44.4

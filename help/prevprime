NAME
    prevprime - nearest prime less than specified number

SYNOPSIS
    prevprime(n [,err])

TYPES
    n           real
    err         integer

    return      positive integer or err

DESCRIPTION
    If n is an integer and 2 < n < 2^32, prevprime(n) returns the
    nearest prime less than n.

    If n <= 2 or >= 2^32 or n is fractional, prevprime(n, err)
    returns the value of err.

    Other cases cause a runtime error.

EXAMPLE
    ; print prevprime(10), prevprime(100), prevprime(1e6)
    7 97 999983

    ; print prevprime(2,-99), prevprime(2^32,-99)
    -99 -99

    ; print prevprime(2)
    pprime arg 1 is <= 2

LIMITS
    2 < n < 2^32

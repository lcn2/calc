NAME
    fgetfield - read the next word from a file

SYNOPSIS
    fgetfield(fs)

TYPES
    fs		file stream open for reading

    return	string or null

DESCRIPTION

    Starting at the current file position, any whitespace
    characters are skipped.  If the reading reaches end-of-file, the
    null value is returned.  Otherwise the function returns the empty
    string "" if the first non-white character is '\0', and in other cases,
    the string formed by the non-white-space characters read until '\0' or
    a white-space character or the end of the file is reached.  In the
    cases where the reading is stopped by '\0' or white-space character,
    the file position will be that immediately after that character.

EXAMPLE

    ; f = fopen("/tmp/junk", "w")
    ; fputs(f, " Alpha Beta \n")
    ; freopen(f, "r")
    ; fgetfield(f)
	"Alpha"
    ; fgetfield(f)
	"Beta"
    ; fgetfield(f)

    ; freopen(f, "w")
    ; fputstr(f, " Alpha  ", "Beta")
    ; freopen(f, "r")
    ; fgetfield(f)
	"Alpha"
    ; fgetfield(f)
	""
    ; fgetfield(f)
	"Beta"

NAME
    log -  base 10 logarithm

SYNOPSIS
    log(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x           nonzero real or complex
    eps         0 < real < 1, defaults to epsilon()

    return      real or complex

DESCRIPTION
    Approximate the base 10 logarithm function of x by a multiple of
    epsilon, the error having absolute value less than 0.75 * eps.

    If y is a positive integer, log(x, 10^-y) will usually be correct
    to the y-th decimal place.

EXAMPLE
    ; print log(10), log(100), log(1e10), log(1e500)
    1 2 10 500

    ; print log(128), log(23209), log(2^17-19)
    ~2.10720996964786836649 ~4.36565642852838930424 ~5.11744696704937330414

    ; print log(2+3i, 1e-5)
    ~0.55696845725899964822+~0.42681936428109216144i

LIMITS
    x != 0
    0 < eps < 1

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qlog(NUMBER *x, NUMBER *eps)
    COMPLEX *c_log(COMPLEX *x, NUMBER *eps)

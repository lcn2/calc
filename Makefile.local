# This file is included all calc Makefiles after the last Makefile variable
# is set and before the first make rule.  This makes this file suitable to
# modify, replace or append Makefile variables.
#
# To replace a Makefile variable, use := symbols.  For example:
#
#	CCWERR:= -Werror
#	DEBUG:= -O0 -g
#
# You can append to an existing Makefile variable using '+=' symbols.
# For example:
#
#	CCOPT+= -Ofast
#	COMMON_CFLAGS+= -std=gnu2x

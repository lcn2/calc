    gcd(x1, x2, ...)

TYPES
    x1, x2, ... rational number

    return	rational number

DESCRIPTION
    If at least one xi is nonzero, gcd(x1, x2, ...) is the
    greatest positive number g for which each xi is a multiple of g.
    If all xi are zero, the gcd is zero.

EXAMPLE
    > print gcd(12, -24, 30), gcd(9/10, 11/5, 4/25), gcd(0,0,0,0,0)
    6 .02 0

LIMITS
    The number of arguments may not to exceed 100.

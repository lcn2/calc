NAME
    fgetfile - read the rest of a file to form a string

SYNOPSIS
    fgetfile(fs)

TYPES
    fs          file stream open for reading

    return      string or null value

DESCRIPTION

    If the current file position for fs is the end of the file, the
    null value is returned.

    Otherwise the function returns the string formed from reading all
    characters from the current file position to the end of the file.

    If the content of the file "newfile" is a sequence of statements that
    could form the body of function definition, the statement sequence

                fs = fopen("newfile", "r");
                eval(fgetfile(fs));

    achieves the same as the command

                read newfile;

EXAMPLE
    ; f = fopen("/tmp/newfile", "w")
    ; fputs(f, "abc\0xyz\n\t\xb0\0\r\v123"
    ; freopen(f, "r")
    ; estr(fgetfile(f))
        ""abc\0xyz\n\t\xb0\0\r\v123""

NAME
    fpathopen - open an absolute or relative filename along a search path

SYNOPSIS
    fpathopen(filename, mode [,searchpath])

TYPES
    filename	string
    mode	string
    searchpath	string

    return	file

DESCRIPTION
    This function opens the file named filename, potentially searching
    for the file along a search path given by searchpath.  If searchpath
    is not given, then CALCPATH search path is used.

    If the filename is absolute, or it has an implied path, then
    searchpath is ignored and the filename is opened directly.
    Absolute filenames, and filenames with an implied path are files
    that begin with:

    	/	# absolute path
	./	# implied path through the current working directory
	../	# implied path through the current working directory parent
	~	# absolute path going through a home directory

    A search path is a :-separated list of directories used to search for
    a filename.  For example:

    	fpathopen("whey", "r", ".:/tmp:/var/tmp:~chongo/pub:~/tmp");

    will cause this function to open the first readable file it
    files while searching through these paths in order:

    	./whey
	/tmp/whey
	/var/tmp/whey
	~chongo/pub/whey
	~/tmp/whey

    IMPORTANT NOTE:

    This function searches along a path by attempting
    to open files under the given mode.  If the mode allows for
    writing and a file can be created, then that file is returned.

    This call open "./gleet" for writing if the current directory is
    writable, even if "./gleet" did not previously exist:

    	fpathopen("gleet", "r", ".:/tmp:/var/tmp:~chongo/pub:~/tmp");

    This call will likely open (and create if needded) for appending,
    the file "/tmp/log" assuming that the user is not allowed to
    create files in the previous system directories:

    	fpathopen("log", "a", "/:/etc:/bin:/usr/bin:/tmp");

    The CALCPATH search path is taken from the $CALCPATH environment
    variable or if no such variable exists, a compiled in default search
    path is used.  See "help environment" and "help calcpath" for more
    information on CALCPATH.

    It should be noted that while CALCPATH is typically used to find
    resource files (*.cal files), this function is not restricted those
    files.  Any filename may be opened.

    A file can be opened for either reading, writing, or appending.
    The mode is controlled by the mode flag as follows:

		 allow	  allow    file is   positioned	  file(*)
       mode	reading	 writing  truncated      at	  mode
       ----	-------  -------  ---------  ---------	  ----
	r	   Y	    N	      N      beginning	  text
	rb	   Y	    N	      N      beginning	  binary
	r+	   Y	    N	      N      beginning	  text
	r+b	   Y	    N	      N      beginning	  binary
	rb+	   Y	    N	      N      beginning	  binary

	w	   N	    Y	      Y      beginning	  text
	wb	   N	    Y	      Y      beginning	  binary
	w+	   Y	    Y	      Y      beginning	  text
	w+b	   Y	    Y	      Y      beginning	  binary
	wb+	   Y	    Y	      Y      beginning	  binary

	a	   N	    Y	      Y         end	  text
	ab	   N	    Y	      Y         end	  binary
	a+	   Y	    Y	      Y         end	  text
	a+b	   Y	    Y	      Y         end	  binary
	ab+	   Y	    Y	      Y         end	  binary

    (*) NOTE on 'b' / binary/text mode:

    	The 'b' or fopen binary mode has no effect on POSIX / Linux
	/ Un*x-like systems.  On those systems a text file is the
	same as a binary file (as it should be for any modern-day
	operating system).  Adding 'b' to an fopen has no effect
	and is ignored.

	Some non-POSIX systems sucn as MS Windoz treat text files
	and binary files differently.  In text mode MS Windoz consider
	"\r\n" and end-of-line character.  On an Apple MAC, the
	text mode end-of-line character is "\r".

    Names of files are subject to ~ expansion just like the C or
    Korn shell.	 For example, the file name:

	~/lib/gleet

    refers to the file 'gleet' under the directory lib located
    in your home directory.  The file name:

	~chongo/was_here

    refers to the a file 'was_here' under the home directory of
    the user 'chongo'.

    If the open is successful, a value of type 'file' will be returned.
    You can use the 'isfile' function to test the return value to see
    if the open succeeded.  You should assign the return value of fopen
    to a variable for later use.  File values can be copied to more than
    one variable, and using any of the variables with the same file value
    will produce the same results.

    Standard input, standard output and standard error are always opened
    and cannot be closed.

    The truth value of an opened file is TRUE.

    If the open is unsuccessful, the numeric value of errno is returned.
    You can the errno() builtin to determine what the errno number means.

EXAMPLE
    ; fd = fpathopen("motd", "r", "/etc:.")
    ; print fd
    "/etc/motd"
    ; fd
	    FILE 3 "/etc/motd" (reading, pos 0)

    ; fd2 = fpathopen("lucas.cal", "r")
    ; print fd2
    "/usr/share/calc/lucas.cal"
    ; fd2
	    FILE 4 "/usr/share/calc/lucas.cal" (reading, pos 0)

    ; fd3 = fpathopen("randmprime.cal", "r", calcpath())
    ; print fd3
    "/usr/share/calc/randmprime.cal"
    ; fd3
	    FILE 5 "/usr/share/calc/randmprime.cal" (reading, pos 0)

    ; fd4 = fpathopen("output", "w", "~/tmp:/tmp:/var/tmp")
    ; print fd4
    "/home/chongo/tmp/output"
    ; fd4
	    FILE 6 "/home/chongo/tmp/output" (writing, pos 0)

    ; !mkdir -p /tmp/log
    ; !touch /tmp/log/file
    ; logfile = fpathopen("log/file", "a", "/tmp:/var/tmp")
    ; print logfile
    "/tmp/log/file"
    ; logfile
	    FILE 7 "/home/chongo/tmp/output" (writing, pos 0)

    ; badfile = fpathopen("no_such_file", "r")
    ; if (!isfile(badfile)) print "error #" errno(badfile) : \
      ":" : strerror(badfile);
    error #2: No such file or directory

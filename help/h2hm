NAME
    h2hm - convert hours into hours, and minutes

SYNOPSIS
    h2hm(hours, h, m [,rnd])

TYPES
    hours       real
    h           null-or-real-valued lvalue with assign-to permission
    m           null-or-real-valued lvalue with assign-to permission
    rnd         nonnegative integer, defaults to config("mod")

    return      mod(hours, 24, rnd)

DESCRIPTION
    Convert hours hours into h hours, and m minutes.

    The return value is a normalized number of hours, and is equivalent
    to the following:

        return_value = mod(hours, 24, rnd);

    The argument rnd, if not given, defaults to config("mod").
    For more information on the effects of rnd, see "help mod".

    Depending on the rounding mode, the return could be a real value
    in the interval [0, 24) or a real value in the interval (-24, 0].
    For the default round mode, the return value is in the interval [0, 24).

    The h argument will be an integer number of hours.

    The value h will be set as if the following were used:

        h = int(return_value);

    For some rounding modes, h will be an integer in the interval [0, 24).
    For other rounding modes, h will be an integer in the interval (-24, 0].
    For the default round mode, h is in the interval [0, 24).

    The m argument will be a real number of minutes.

    The value m will be set as if the following were used:

        tmp = return_value - h;
        m = tmp * 60;
        free(tmp);

    For some rounding modes, m will be a real value in the interval [0, 60).
    For other rounding modes, m will be a real value in the interval (-60, 0].
    For the default round mode, m will be in the interval [0, 60).

    The following shows relationship between the return value and the resulting
    h, and m values:

        return_value == h + m/60;

EXAMPLE
    ; ## if args are undefined, pre-declare them or assign them as args

    ; global h, m;

    ; print h2hm(12.3456,h,m), h, m;
    12.3456 12 20.736
    ; print h2hm(1234.5678,h,m), h, m;
    10.5678 10 34.068
    ; print h2hm(-1234.5678,h,m), h, m;
    13.4322 13 25.932

    ; print h2hm(654.321,hour=,min=), hour, min;
    6.321 6 19.26
    ; print h2hm(-654.321,hour=,min=), hour, min;
    17.679 17 40.74
    ; print h2hm(24.321,hour=,min=), hour, min;
    0.321 0 19.26

    ; ## certain non-default rounding modes can return negative values

    ; print h2hm(654.321,hour=,min=,1), hour, min;
    -17.679 -17 -40.74
    ; print h2hm(-654.321,hour=,min=,1), hour, min;
    -6.321 -6 -19.26
    ; print h2hm(24.321,hour=,min=,1), hour, min;
    -23.679 -23 -40.7

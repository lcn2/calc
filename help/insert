NAME
    insert - insert one or more elements into a list at a given position

SYNOPSIS
    insert(x, y, z_0, z_1, ...)

TYPES
    x           lvalue whose value is a list
    y           int
    z_0, ...    any

    return      null value

DESCRIPTION
     If after evaluation of z_0, z_1, ..., x is a list with contents
     (x_0, x_1, ..., x_y-1, x_y, ..., x_n-1), then after insert(),
     x has contents (x_0, x_1, ..., x_y-1, z_0, z_1, ..., x_y, ..., x_n-1),
     i.e. z_0, z_1, ... are inserted in order immediately before the
     element with index y (so that z_0 is now x[[y]]), or if y = n,
     after the last element x_n-1.  An error occurs if y > n.

EXAMPLE
    ; A = list(2,3,4)
    ; print A

    list (3 elements, 3 nonzero):
      [[0]] = 2
      [[1]] = 3
      [[2]] = 4

    ; insert(A, 1, 5, 6)
    ; print A

    list (5 elements, 5 nonzero):
      [[0]] = 1
      [[1]] = 5
      [[2]] = 6
      [[3]] = 3
      [[4]] = 4

    ; insert(A, 2, remove(A))
    ; print A

    list (5 elements, 5 nonzero):
      [[0]] = 1
      [[1]] = 5
      [[2]] = 4
      [[3]] = 6
      [[4]] = 3

LIMITS
    insert() can have at most 100 arguments
    o <= y <= size(x)

LINK LIBRARY
    none

# On some systems, /bin/sh is a rather reduced shell with

# If your system has a up to date, bash shell, then

#
#	SHELL= bash
#
# On some systems such as macOS, the bash shell is very
# far behind to the point where is cannot be depended on.
# On such systems, the sh may be a much better alternative

# PREFIX - Top level location for calc
#
# The PREFIX is often prepended to paths within calc and calc Makefiles.
#
# Starting with calc v2.13.0.1, nearly all Makefile places that used
# /usr/local now use ${PREFIX}.  An exception is the olduninstall rule
# and, of course, this section. :-)
#
# NOTE: The ${PREFIX} is not the same as ${T}.  The ${T} specifies
#	a top level directory under which calc installs things.
#	While usually ${T} is empty, it can be specific path
#	as if calc where "chrooted" during an install.
#	The ${PREFIX} value, during install, is a path between
#	the top level ${T} install directory and the object
#	such as an include file.
#
# NOTE: See also, ${T}, below.
#
# There are some paths that do NOT call under ${PREFIX}, such as
# ${CALCPATH}, that include paths not under ${PREFIX}, but those
# too are exceptions to this general rule.
#
# When in doubt, try:
#
#	PREFIX= /usr/local
#
PREFIX= /usr/local
#PREFIX= /usr
#PREFIX= /usr/global

# CCBAN is given to ${CC} in order to control if banned.h is in effect.
#
# The banned.h attempts to ban the use of certain dangerous functions
# that, if improperly used, could compromise the computational integrity
# if calculations.
#
# In the case of calc, we are motivated in part by the desire for calc
# to correctly calculate: even during extremely long calculations.
#
# If UNBAN is NOT defined, then calling certain functions
# will result in a call to a non-existent function (link error).
#
# While we do NOT encourage defining UNBAN, there may be
# a system / compiler environment where re-defining a
# function may lead to a fatal compiler complication.
# If that happens, consider compiling as:
#
#	make clobber all chk CCBAN=-DUNBAN
#
# as see if this is a work-a-round.
#
# If YOU discover a need for the -DUNBAN work-a-round, PLEASE tell us!
# Please send us a bug report.  See the file:
#

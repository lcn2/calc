NAME
    dp - dot product of two vectors

SYNOPSIS
    dp(x, y)

TYPES
    x, y        1-dimensional matrices of the same size

    return      depends on the nature of the elements of x and y

DESCRIPTION
    Compute the dot product of two 1-dimensional matrices.

    Let:

        x = {x0, x1, ... xn}
        y = {y0, y1, ... yn}

    Then dp(x,y) returns the result of the calculation:

        x0*y0 + x1*y1 + ... + xn*yn

EXAMPLE
    ; mat x[3] = {2,3,4}
    ; mat y[1:3] = {3,4,5}
    ; print dp(x,y)
    38

LIMITS
    none

LINK LIBRARY
    VALUE matdot(MATRIX *x, MATRIX *y)

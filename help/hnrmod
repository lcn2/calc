NAME
    hnrmod - compute mod h * 2^n +r

SYNOPSIS
    hnrmod(v, h, n, r)

TYPES
    v		integer
    h		integer
    n		integer
    r		integer

    return	integer

DESCRIPTION
    Compute the value:

	v % (h * 2^n +r)

    where:

	h > 0
	n > 0
	r == -1, 0 or 1

    This builtin in faster than the standard mod in that is makes use
    of shifts and additions when h == 1.  When h > 1, a division by h
    is also needed.

EXAMPLE
    > print hnrmod(2^177-1, 1, 177, -1), hnrmod(10^40, 17, 51, 1)
    0 33827019788296445

LIMITS
    h > 0
    2^31 > n > 0
    r == -1, 0 or 1

LINK LIBRARY
    void zhnrmod(ZVALUE v, ZVALUE h, ZVALUE zn, ZVALUE zr, ZVALUE *res)

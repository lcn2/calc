NAME
    runtime - CPU time used by the current process in both user and kernel modes

SYNOPSIS
    runtime()

TYPES
    return	nonnegative real

DESCRIPTION
    In POSIX based systems, this function will return the CPU seconds
    used by the current process in both user and kernel mode.  Time
    spent in the kernel executing system calls and time spend executing
    user code (such as performing computation on behalf of calc) are
    both included.

    On non-POSIX based systems, this function will always return 0.
    In particular, most MS windows based systems do not have the required
    POSIX system call and so this function will always return 0.

EXAMPLE
    The result for this example will depend on the speed of the CPU
    and precision of the operating CPU time accounting sub-system:

    ; t = runtime();
    ; x = ptest(2^4253-1);
    ; runtime() - t;
	1.288804

LIMITS
    On non-POSIX based systems, this function always returns 0.

LINK LIBRARY
    none

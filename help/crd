NAME
    crd - trigonometric chord of a unit circle

SYNOPSIS
    crd(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x           number (real or complex)
    eps         0 < real < 1, defaults to epsilon()

    return      number

DESCRIPTION
    Calculate length of unit circle chord with angle x to a multiple of eps with error less in
    absolute value than .75 * eps.

    A chord of a circle is a straight line segment whose endpoints lie on a arc of a circle.
    A chord extended infinitely on both directions into a line would produce a secant line.

    This function is sometimes called chord, is equivalent to:

        crd(x) = 2 * sin(x / 2)

EXAMPLE
    ; print crd(1/2), crd(5/7), crd(42/7)

    ; print crd(1, 1e-5), crd(1, 1e-10), crd(1, 1e-15), crd(1, 1e-20)

    ; print crd(2 + 3i, 1e-5), crd(2 + 3i, 1e-10)
    3.95896+2.3009i 3.9589688712+2.3009091988i

    ; pi = pi(1e-20)
    ; print crd(pi/6), crd(pi/2), crd(pi)

NAME
    ln  -  logarithm function

SYNOPSIS
    ln(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x           nonzero real or complex
    eps         0 < real < 1, defaults to epsilon()

    return      real or complex

DESCRIPTION
    Approximate the natural logarithm function of x by a multiple of
    epsilon, the error having absolute value less than 0.75 * eps.
    If n is a positive integer, ln(x, 10^-n) will usually be correct
    to the n-th decimal place.

EXAMPLE
    ; print ln(10, 1e-5), ln(10, 1e-10), ln(10, 1e-15), ln(10, 1e-20)
    2.30259 2.302585093 2.302585092994046 2.30258509299404568402

    ; print ln(2+3i, 1e-5), ln(2+3i, 1e-10)
    1.28247+0.98279i 1.2824746787+0.9827937232i

LIMITS
    x != 0
    0 < eps < 1

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qln(NUMBER *x, NUMBER *eps)
    COMPLEX *c_ln(COMPLEX *x, NUMBER *eps)

NAME
    indices - indices for specified matrix or association element

SYNOPSIS
    indices(V, index)

TYPES
    V           matrix or association
    index       integer

    return      list with up to 4 elements

DESCRIPTION
    For 0 <= index < size(V), indices(V, index) returns list(i_0, i_1, ...)
    for which V[i_0, i_1, ...] is the same lvalue as V[[index]].

    For other values of index, a null value is returned.

    This function can be useful for determining those elements for which
    the indices satisfy some condition.  This is particularly so for
    associations since these have no simple relation between the
    double-bracket index and the single-bracket indices, which may be
    non-integer numbers or strings or other types of value.  The
    information provided by indices() is often required after the use
    of search() or rsearch() which, when successful, return the
    double-bracket index of the item found.

EXAMPLE
    ; mat M[2,3,1:5]

    ; indices(M, 11)
    list (3 elements, 2 nonzero):
            [[0]] = 0
            [[1]] = 2
            [[2]] = 2

    ; A = assoc();

    ; A["cat", "dog"] = "fight";
    ; A[2,3,5,7] = "primes";
    ; A["square", 3] = 9

    ; indices(A, search(A, "primes"))
    list (4 elements, 4 nonzero):
            [[0]] = 2
            [[1]] = 3
            [[2]] = 5
            [[3]] = 7

LIMITS
    abs(index) < 2^31

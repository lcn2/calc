NAME
    minv - inverse of an integer modulo a specified integer

SYNOPSIS
    minv(x, md)

TYPES
    x           integer
    md          integer

    return      integer

DESCRIPTION
    If x and md are not relatively prime, zero is returned.
    Otherwise v = minv(x, md) is the canonical residue v modulo md
    for which v * x is congruent to 1 modulo md.   The canonical
    residues modulo md are determined as follows by md and bits 0, 2
    and 4 of config("mod") (other bits are ignored).

                config("mod")     md > 0              md < 0

                    0           0 < v < md         md < v < 0
                    1         -md < v < 0           0 < v < -md
                    4           0 < v < md          0 < v < -md
                    5         -md < v < 0          md < v < 0
                   16       -md/2 < v <= md/2   md/2 <= v < -md/2
                   17      -md/2 <= v < md/2     md/2 < v <= -md/2
                   20       -md/2 < v <= md/2    md/2 < v <= -md/2
                   21      -md/2 <= v < md/2    md/2 <= v < -md/2

EXAMPLE
    ; c = config("mod", 0)
    ; print minv(3,10), minv(-3,10), minv(3,-10), minv(-3,-10), minv(4,10)
    7 3 -3 -7 0

    ; c = config("mod",16)
    ; print minv(3,10), minv(-3,10), minv(3,-10), minv(-3,-10), minv(4,10)
    -3 3 -3 3 0

LIMITS

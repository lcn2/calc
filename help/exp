NAME
    exp - exponential function

SYNOPSIS
    exp(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x           real or complex
    eps         0 < real < 1, defaults to epsilon()

    return      real or complex

DESCRIPTION
    Approximate the exponential function of x by a multiple of epsilon,
    the error having absolute value less than 0.75 * eps.
    If n is a positive integer, exp(x, 10^-n) will usually be
    correct to the n-th decimal place, which, for large positive x
    will give many significant figures.

EXAMPLE
    ; print exp(2, 1e-5), exp(2,1e-10), exp(2, 1e-15), exp(2, 1e-20)
    7.38906 7.3890560989 7.38905609893065 7.38905609893065022723

    ; print exp(30, 1e5), exp(30, 1), exp(30, 1e-10)
    10686474600000 10686474581524 10686474581524.4621469905

    ; print exp(-20, 1e-5), exp(-20, 1e-10), exp(-20, 1e-15), exp(-20, 1e-20)
    0 0.0000000021 0.000000002061154 0.00000000206115362244

    ; print exp(1+2i, 1e-5), exp(1+2i, 1e-10)
    -1.1312+2.47173i -1.1312043838+2.471726672i

NAME
    csch - hyperbolic cosecant

SYNOPSIS
    csch(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x           nonzero real
    eps         0 < real < 1, defaults to epsilon()

    return      real

DESCRIPTION
    Calculate the csch of x to a multiple of epsilon, with error less in
    absolute value than .75 * eps.

    csch(x) = 2/(exp(x) - exp(-x))

EXAMPLE
    ; print csch(1, 1e-5), csch(1, 1e-10), csch(1, 1e-15), csch(1, 1e-20)

LIMITS
    0 < eps < 1

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qcsch(NUMBER *x, NUMBER *eps)

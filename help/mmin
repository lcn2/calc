NAME
    mmin - least-absolute-value residues modulo a specified number

SYNOPSIS
    mmin(x, md)

TYPES
    x           number (real or complex), matrix, list, object
    md          real

    return      real

DESCRIPTION
    If x is real and md is nonzero, mmin(x, md) returns the real
    number v congruent to x modulo md for which abs(v) <= md/2
    and if abs(v) = md/2, then v = md/2.

    If x is real and md is zero, mmin(x, md) returns x.

    For complex, matrix, list or object x, see the help file for mod: for
    all x and md, mmin(x, md) returns the same as mod(x, md, 16).

EXAMPLE
    ; print mmin(3,6), mmin(4,6), mmin(5,6), mmin(6,6), mmin(7,6)
    3 -2 -1 0 1

    ; print mmin(1.25, 2.5), mmin(-1.25,2.5), mmin(1.25, -2.5)
    1.25 1.25 -1.25

NAME
    coversin - coversed trigonometric sine

SYNOPSIS
    coversin(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x           number (real or complex)
    eps         0 < real < 1, defaults to epsilon()

    return      number

DESCRIPTION
    Calculate the coversed trigonometric sine of x to a multiple of eps with error less in
    absolute value than .75 * eps.

    This function is sometimes called covers, or cvs, is equivalent to:

        coversin(x) = 1 - sin(x)

EXAMPLE
    ; print coversin(1/2), coversin(5/7), coversin(42/7)
    0.52057446139579699973 0.3449221028214814258 1.27941549819892587281

    ; print coversin(1, 1e-5), coversin(1, 1e-10), coversin(1, 1e-15), coversin(1, 1e-20)
    0.15853 0.1585290152 0.158529015192104 0.15852901519210349335

    ; print coversin(2 + 3i, 1e-5), coversin(2 + 3i, 1e-10)
    -8.1545+4.16891i -8.1544991469+4.16890696i

    ; pi = pi(1e-20)
    ; print coversin(pi/6), coversin(pi/2), coversin(pi)
    0.5 0 1

LIMITS

    access(name [, mode])

TYPES
    name        string
    mode        integer or string containing only 'r', 'w', 'x' characters

DESCRIPTION
    access(name) or access(name, 0) or access(name, "") returns the null

    bits or characters of the mode argument: 'r' or bit 2 for reading,
    'w' or bit 1 for writing, 'x' or bit 0 for execution.

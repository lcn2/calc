NAME
    bit - whether a given binary bit is set in a value

SYNOPSIS
    bit(x, y)

TYPES
    x           real
    y           int

    return      int

DESCRIPTION
    Determine if the binary bit y is set in x.  If:

             x
        int(---) mod 2 == 1
            2^y

    return 1, otherwise return 0.

EXAMPLE
    ; print bit(9,0), bit(9,1), bit(9,2), bit(9,3)
    1 0 0 1

    ; print bit(9,4), bit(0,0), bit(9,-1)
    0 0 0

    ; print bit(1.25, -2), bit(1.25, -1), bit(1.25, 0)
    1 0 1

    ; p = pi()
    ; print bit(p, 1), bit(p, -2), bit(p, -3)
    1 0 1

LIMITS
    -2^31 < y < 2^31

LINK LIBRARY
    BOOL qbit(NUMBER *x, long y)

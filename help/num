NAME
    num - numerator of a real number

SYNOPSIS
    num(x)

TYPES
    x		real

    return	integer

DESCRIPTION
    For real x, den(x) returns the denominator of x.  In calc,
    real values are actually rational values.  Each calc real
    value can be uniquely expressed as:

	n / d

    where:

	n and d are integers
	gcd(n,d) == 1
	d > 0

    If x = n/x, then den(x) == n.

EXAMPLE
    ; print num(7), num(-1.25), num(121/33)
    7 -5 11

LIMITS
    none

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qnum(NUMBER *x)

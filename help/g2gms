NAME
    g2gms - convert gradians into gradians, minutes, and seconds

SYNOPSIS
    g2gms(grads, g, m, s [,rnd])

TYPES
    grads	real
    g		null-or-real-valued lvalue with assign-to permission
    m		null-or-real-valued lvalue with assign-to permission
    s		null-or-real-valued lvalue with assign-to permission
    rnd		nonnegative integer, defaults to config("mod")

    return	mod(grads, 400, rnd)

DESCRIPTION
    Convert grads gradians into g gradians, m minutes, and s seconds.

    The return value is a normalized number of gradians, and is equivalent
    to the following:

	return_value = mod(grads, 400, rnd);

    The argument rnd, if not given, defaults to config("mod").
    For more information on the effects of rnd, see "help mod".

    Depending on the rounding mode, the return could be a real value
    in the interval [0, 400) or a real value in the interval (-400, 0].
    For the default round mode, the return value is in the interval [0, 400).

    The g argument will be an integer number of gradians.

    The value g will be set as if the following were used:

    	g = int(return_value);

    For some rounding modes, g will be an integer in the interval [0, 400).
    For other rounding modes, g will be an integer in the interval (-400, 0].
    For the default round mode, g is in the interval [0, 400).

    The m argument will be an integer number of minutes.

    The value m will be set as if the following were used:

	tmp = return_value - g;
	tmp_m = tmp * 60;
	free(tmp);
	m = int(tmp_m);

    For some rounding modes, m will be an integer in the interval [0, 60).
    For other rounding modes, m will be an integer in the interval (-60, 0].
    For the default round mode, m will be in the interval [0, 60).

    The s argument will be a real number of seconds.

    The value s will be set as if the following were used:

	tmp = tmp_m - m;
	free(tmp_m);
	s = tmp * 60;
	free(tmp);

    For some rounding modes, s will be a real value in the interval [0, 60).
    For other rounding modes, s will be a real value in the interval (-60, 0].
    For the default round mode, s will be in the interval [0, 60).

    The following shows relationship between the return value and the resulting
    g, m, and s values:

    	return_value == g + m/60 + s/3600;


EXAMPLE
    /* if args are undefined, pre-declare them or assign them as args */

    ; global g, m, s;

    ; print g2gms(12.3456,g,m,s), g, m, s;
    12.3456 12 20 44.16
    ; print g2gms(1234.5678,g,m,s), g, m, s;
    34.5678 34 34 4.08
    ; print g2gms(-1234.5678,g,m,s), g, m, s;
    365.4322 365 25 55.92

    ; print g2gms(654.321,grad=,min=,sec=), grad, min, sec;
    254.321 254 19 15.6
    ; print g2gms(-654.321,grad=,min=,sec=), grad, min, sec;
    145.679 145 40 44.4
    ; print g2gms(400.321,grad=,min=,sec=), grad, min, sec;
    0.321 0 19 15.6

    /* certain non-default rounding modes can return negative values */

    ; print g2gms(654.321,grad=,min=,sec=,1), grad, min, sec;
    -145.679 -145 -40 -44.4
    ; print g2gms(-654.321,grad=,min=,sec=,1), grad, min, sec;
    -254.321 -254 -19 -15.6
    ; print g2gms(400.321,grad=,min=,sec=,1), grad, min, sec;
    -399.679 -399 -40 -44.4

NAME
    push - push one or more values into the front of a list

SYNOPSIS
    push(x, y_0, y_1, ...)

TYPES
    x           lvalue whose value is a list
    y_0, ...    any

    return      null value

DESCRIPTION
     If after evaluation of y_0, y_1, ..., x is a list with
     contents (x_0, x_1, ...), then after push(x, y_0, y_1, ..., y_n-1),
     x has contents (y_n-1, ..., y_1, y_0, x_0, x_1, ...), i.e. the
     values of y_0, y_1, ... are inserted in succession at the beginning
     of the list.

     This function is equivalent to insert(x, 0, y_n-1, ..., y_1, y_0).

EXAMPLE
    ; A = list(2,"three")
    ; print A

    list (2 elements, 2 nonzero):
      [[0]] = 2
      [[1]] = "three"

    ; push(A, 4i, 7^2)
    ; print A

    list (4 elements, 4 nonzero):
      [[0]] = 49
      [[1]] = 4i
      [[2]] = 2
      [[3]] = "three"

    ; push (A, pop(A), pop(A))
    ; print A

    list (4 elements, 4 nonzero):
      [[0]] = 4i
      [[1]] = 49
      [[2]] = 2
      [[3]] = "three"

LIMITS
    push() can have at most 100 arguments

LINK LIBRARY

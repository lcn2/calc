We welcome and encourage you to send us:

    * calc resource files
    * calc shell scripts
    * any builtin functions that you have modified or written
    * custom functions that you have modified or written
    * any other source code modifications

Prior to doing so, you should consider applying your changes to the most
recent version of calc.

Landon Noll maintains the official calc home page at:

	http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/calc/

See:

	http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/calc/calc-download.html

for information on how to obtain up a recent version of calc.

In order to consider integrating your code, we need:

    * the calc version you are working with (use the latest calc, see above)
    * new help files or help file patches, if applicable (documentation)
    * proposed text for the CHANGES file (brief description of what it does)
    * regress.cal test patch, if applicable
    * your source code and/or source code changes (:-))

The best way to send us new code, if your changes are small, is
via a patch (diff -c from the latest alpha code to your code).
If your change is large, you should send entire files (either
as a diff -c /dev/null your-file patch, or as a uuencoded and
gziped (or compressed) tar file).

To contribute code, scripts, resource files and/or to help please
join the low volume calc mailing list calc-tester.  Then send
your contribution to the calc-tester mailing list.

NAME
    fscanf - formatted scan of a file stream

SYNOPSIS
    fscanf(fs, fmt, x_1, x_2, ...)

TYPES
    fs			file stream open for reading
    fmt			string
    x_1, x_2, ...	lvalues

    return	null, nonnegative integer, or error value

DESCRIPTION
    If the current position for fs is EOF, the null value is returned.

    Otherwise, until the terminating null character of fmt is encountered
    or end-of-file for fs is reached, characters other than '%' and white
    space are read from fmt and compared with the corresponding characters
    read from fs.  If the characters match, the reading continues.  If they
    do not match, an integer value is returned and the file position for
    fs is the position of the non-matching character.  If white space
    is encountered in fmt, any white space characters read from
    fs are skipped until either end-of-file is reached or a non-white-space
    character is read and comparisons continue under the control of the
    next non-white character and following characters in fmt.

    When a '%' is encountered in fmt, if this is immediately followed by
    another '%', the pair is considered as if just one '%' were read and
    if reading from fmt and fs continues if and only if fs has a matching
    '%'.  A single '%' read from fmt is taken to indicate the beginning of
    a conversion specification field consisting in succession of:

		an optional '*',
		optional decimal digits,
		one of 'c', 's', 'n', 'f', 'e', 'i' or a scanset specifier.

    A scanset specifier starts with '[' and an optional '^', then an optional
    ']', then optional other characters, and ends with ']'.   If any
    other sequence of characters follows the '%', characters before the
    first exceptional character (which could be the terminating null
    character of the fmt string) are ignored, e.g. the sequence " %*3d " does
    the same as " d ".	If there is no '*' at the beginning of the specifier,
    and the list x_1, x_2, ... has not been exhausted,
    a value will be assigned to the next lvalue in the list; if no lvalue
    remains, the reading of fs stops and the function returns the number
    of assignments that have been made.

    Occurrence of '*' indicates that characters as specified are to be read
    but no assignment will be made.

    The digits, if any, read at this stage in the specifier are taken to
    be decimal digits of an integer which becomes the maximum "width"
    (i.e. for string-type values, the number of characters to be read from
    fs); absence of digits or all zero digits in the 'c'
    case are taken to mean width = 1.  Zero width for the other cases are
    treated as if infinite.   Fewer characters than the specifier width
    may be read if end-of-file is reached or in the case of scanset
    specification, an exceptional character is encountered.

    If the ending character is 'c', characters are read from fs to
    form a string, which will be ignored or in the non-'*' case, assigned
    to the next lvalue.

    In the 's' case, reading to form the string starts at the first non-white
    character (if any) and ceases when end-of-file or further white space
    is encountered or the specified width has been attained.

    The cases 'f', 'e', 'r', 'i' may be considered to indicate expectation of
    floating-point, exponential, ratio, or integer representation of the
    number to be read.	For example, 'i'
    might be taken to suggest a number like +2345; 'r' might suggest
    a representation like -27/49; 'e' might suggest a representation like
    1.24e-7; 'f' might suggest a representation like 27.145. However, there
    is no test that the result conforms to the specifier.  Whatever
    the specifier in these cases, the result depends on the characters read
    until a space or other exceptional character is read.  The
    characters read may include one or more occurrences of +, -, * as
    well as /, interpreted in the usual way, with left-to-right associativity
    for + and -, and for * and /.  Also acceptable is a trailing i to
    indicate an imaginary number.  For example the expression

			2+3/4*7i+3.15e7

    would be interpreted as for an ordinary evaluation.	 A decimal fraction
    may have more than one dot: dots after the first, which is taken to be
    the decimal point, are ignored.  Thus "12.3..45e6.7" is interpreted
    as if it were "12.345e67".

    For the number specifiers 'f', 'e', 'r', 'i', any specified width is
    ignored.

    For the specifier 'n', the current value of the file-position indicator
    is assigned to the corresponding lvalue. (Any width or skip specification
    is ignored.)


EXAMPLE
    > global a, b, c
    > f = fopen("/tmp/junk", "w+")
    > fputs(f, "Alpha Beta Gamma")
    > rewind(f)
    > fscanf(f, "Alpha Gamma")
    > fgets(f)
	"Beta Gamma"
    > rewind(f)
    > fscanf(f, "%5c", a)
	1
    > a
	"Alpha"
    > fgets(f)
	" Beta Gamma"
    > rewind(f)
    > fscanf(f, "%3c%s%[^m]", a, b, c)
	3
    > print a, b
    Alp ha
    > print c
    Beta Ga
    > fgets(f)
	"mma"

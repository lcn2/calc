NAME
    r2g - convert radians to gradians

SYNOPSIS
    r2g(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x		number (real or complex)
    eps		nonzero real, defaults to epsilon()

    return	number

DESCRIPTION
    Given x radians, return the equivalent number of gradians.

    The eps controls the precision of the calculated internal
    constant pi / 200.

EXAMPLE
    ; pi = pi()
    ; print r2g(pi), r2g(pi/3), r2g(2*pi)
    200 ~66.66666666666666666667 400

    ; print r2g(pi+4i), r2g(pi/4 + 1i*pi), r2g(pi/5 + 5i*pi)
    200+~254.64790894703253723043i 50+200i 40+1000i

LIMITS
    eps > 0

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qpidiv200(NUMBER *eps)

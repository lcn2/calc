NAME
    isblk - whether or not a value is a block

SYNOPSIS
    isblk(val)

TYPES
    val		any

    return	0, 1, or 2

DESCRIPTION
    isblk(val) returns 1 if val is an unnamed block, 2 if val is a
    named block, 0 otherwise.

    Note that a named block B retains its name after its data block is
    freed by rmblk(B).	That a named block B has null data block may be
    tested using sizeof(B);  this returns 0 if and only if the memory
    has been freed.

EXAMPLE
    > A = blk()
    > isblk(A)
	1

    > B = blk("beta")
    > isblk(B)
	2

    > isblk(3)
	0

LIMITS
    none

LINK LIBRARY
    none - XXX ???

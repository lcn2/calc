NAME
    quo - compute integer quotient of a value by a real number

SYNOPSIS
    quo(x, y, rnd) or x // y

TYPES
    If x is a matrix or list, the returned value is a matrix or list v of
    the same structure for which each element v[[i]] = quo(x[[i]], y, rnd).

    If x is an xx-object or x is not an object and y is an xx-object,
    this function calls the user-defined function xx_quo(x, y, rnd);
    the types of arguments and returned value are as required by the
    definition of xx_quo().

    If neither x nor y is an object, and x is not a matrix or list:

    x		number (real or complex)
    y		real
    rnd		integer, defaults to config("quo")

    return	number

DESCRIPTION
    If x is real or complex and y is zero, quo(x, y, rnd) returns zero.

    If x is complex, quo(x, y, rnd) returns
		 quo(re(x), y, rnd) + quo(im(x), y, rnd) * 1i.

    In the following it is assumed that x is real and y is nonzero.

    If x/y is an integer quo(x, y, rnd) returns x/y.

    If x is real, y nonzero and x/y is not an integer, x // y returns
       one of the two integers v for which abs(x/y - v) < 1.  Which
       integer is returned is controlled by rnd as follows:

		rnd	sign of x/y - v		Description of rounding

		0	      +			down, towards minus infinity
		1	      -			up, towards infinity
		2	    sgn(x/y)		towards zero
		3	   -sgn(x/y)		from zero
		4	    sgn(y)
		5	   -sgn(y)
		6	    sgn(x)
		7	   -sgn(x)
		8				to nearest even integer
		9				to nearest odd integer
	       10				even if x/y > 0, otherwise odd
	       11				odd if x/y > 0, otherwise even
	       12				even if y > 0, otherwise odd
	       13				odd if y > 0, otherwise even
	       14				even if x > 0, otherwise odd
	       15				odd if x > 0, otherwise even

	     16-31				to nearest integer when this
						is uniquely determined;
						otherwise, when x/y is a
						half-integer, as if
						rnd replaced by rnd & 15

EXAMPLE
    print quo(11,5,0), quo(11,5,1), quo(-11,5,2), quo(-11,-5,3)
    2 3 -2 3

    print quo(12.5,5,16), quo(12.5,5,17), quo(12.5,5,24), quo(-7.5,-5,24)
    2 3 2 2

LIMITS
    none

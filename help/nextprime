    nextprime - nearest prime greater than specified number

SYNOPSIS
    nextprime(n [,err])

TYPES
    n           real
    err         integer

    return      positive integer or err

DESCRIPTION
    If n is an integer less than 2^32, nextprime(n) returns the
    first prime greater than n.

    If n >= 2^32 or n is fractional, nextprime(n, err) returns the value
    of err.

    Other cases cause a runtime error.

EXAMPLE
    ; print nextprime(10), nextprime(100), nextprime(1e6)
    11 101 1000003

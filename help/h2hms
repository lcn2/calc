NAME
    h2hms - convert hours into hours, minutes, and seconds

SYNOPSIS
    h2hms(hours, h, m, s [,rnd])

TYPES
    hours	real
    h		null-or-real-valued lvalue with assign-to permission
    m		null-or-real-valued lvalue with assign-to permission
    s		null-or-real-valued lvalue with assign-to permission
    rnd		nonnegative integer, defaults to config("mod")

    return	mod(hours, 24, rnd)

DESCRIPTION
    Convert hours hours into h hours, m minutes, and s seconds.

    The return value is a normalized number of hours, and is equivalent
    to the following:

	return_value = mod(hours, 24, rnd);

    The argument rnd, if not given, defaults to config("mod").
    For more information on the effects of rnd, see "help mod".

    Depending on the rounding mode, the return could be a real value
    in the interval [0, 24) or a real value in the interval (-24, 0].
    For the default round mode, the return value is in the interval [0, 24).

    The h argument will be an integer number of hours.

    The value h will be set as if the following were used:

    	h = int(return_value);

    For some rounding modes, h will be an integer in the interval [0, 24).
    For other rounding modes, h will be an integer in the interval (-24, 0].
    For the default round mode, h is in the interval [0, 24).

    The m argument will be an integer number of minutes.

    The value m will be set as if the following were used:

	tmp = return_value - h;
	tmp_m = tmp * 60;
	free(tmp);
	m = int(tmp_m);

    For some rounding modes, m will be an integer in the interval [0, 60).
    For other rounding modes, m will be an integer in the interval (-60, 0].
    For the default round mode, m will be in the interval [0, 60).

    The s argument will be a real number of seconds.

    The value s will be set as if the following were used:

	tmp = tmp_m - m;
	free(tmp_m);
	s = tmp * 60;
	free(tmp);

    For some rounding modes, s will be a real value in the interval [0, 60).
    For other rounding modes, s will be a real value in the interval (-60, 0].
    For the default round mode, s will be in the interval [0, 60).

    The following shows relationship between the return value and the resulting
    h, m, and s values:

    	return_value == h + m/60 + s/3600;


EXAMPLE
    /* if args are undefined, pre-declare them or assign them as args */

    ; global h, m, s;

    ; print h2hms(12.3456,h,m,s), h, m, s;
    12.3456 12 20 44.16
    ; print h2hms(1234.5678,h,m,s), h, m, s;
    10.5678 10 34 4.08
    ; print h2hms(-1234.5678,h,m,s), h, m, s;
    13.4322 13 25 55.92

    ; print h2hms(654.321,hour=,min=,sec=), hour, min, sec;
    6.321 6 19 15.6
    ; print h2hms(-654.321,hour=,min=,sec=), hour, min, sec;
    17.679 17 40 44.4
    ; print h2hms(24.321,hour=,min=,sec=), hour, min, sec;
    0.321 0 19 15.6

    /* certain non-default rounding modes can return negative values */

    ; print h2hms(654.321,hour=,min=,sec=,1), hour, min, sec;
    -17.679 -17 -40 -44.4
    ; print h2hms(-654.321,hour=,min=,sec=,1), hour, min, sec;
    -6.321 -6 -19 -15.6
    ; print h2hms(24.321,hour=,min=,sec=,1), hour, min, sec;
    -23.679 -23 -40 -44.4

SYNOPSIS
    lcm(x1, x2, ...)

TYPES
    x1, x2, ... rational number

    return	rational number

DESCRIPTION
    Compute the least common multiple of one or more rational numbers.

    If no xi is zero, lcm(x1, x2, ...) is the least positive number v
    for which v is a multiple of each xi.  If at least one xi is zero,
    the lcm is zero.

EXAMPLE
    ; print lcm(12, -24, 30), lcm(9/10, 11/5, 4/25), lcm(2)
    -120 79.2 2

NAME
    conj - complex conjugate

SYNOPSIS
    conj(x)

TYPES
    If x is an object of type xx, conj(x) calls xx_conj(x).

    For non-object x:

    x		real, complex, or matrix

    return	real, complex, or matrix

DESCRIPTION

    For real x, conj(x) returns x.

    For complex x, conj(x) returns re(x) - im(x) * 1i.

    For matrix x, conj(x) returns a matrix of the same structure as x
    in which each element t of x has been replaced by conj(t).

    For xx objects, xx_conj(a) may return any type of value, but
    for the properties usually expected of conjugates, xx_conj(a)
    would return an xx object in which each number component is the
    conjugate of the corresponding component of a.

EXAMPLE
    > print conj(3), conj(3 + 4i)
    3 3-4i

LIMITS
    none

LINK LIBRARY
    void conjvalue(VALUE *x, *res)

NAME
    polar - specify a complex number by modulus (radius) and argument (angle)

SYNOPSIS
    polar(r, t [, eps])

TYPES
    r           real
    t           real
    eps         nonzero real, defaults to epsilon()

    return      number (real or complex)

DESCRIPTION
    Returns the real or complex number with real and imaginary parts
    multiples of epps nearest or next to nearest to r * cos(t) and
    r * sin(t) respectively.  The error for each part will be less
    than 0.75 * abs(eps), but usually less than 0.5 * abs(eps).

EXAMPLE
    ; print polar(2, 0), polar(1, 2, 1e-5), polar(1, 2, 1e-10)
    2 -0.41615+0.9093i -0.4161468365+0.9092974268i

    ; pi = pi(1e-10); eps = 1e-5
    ; print polar(2, pi/4, eps), polar(2, pi/2, eps), polar(2, 3*pi/4, eps)
    1.41421+1.41421i 2i -1.414215+1.41421i

LIMITS
    eps != 0

LINK LIBRARY
    COMPLEX *c_polar(NUMBER *r, NUMBER *t, NUMBER *eps);

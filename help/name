NAME
    name - return name of some kinds of structure

SYNOPSIS
    name(val)

TYPES
    val         any

    return      string or null value

DESCRIPTION
    If val is a named block or open file stream, name(val) returns the
    name associated with val.  Otherwise the null value is returned.

    Since the name associated with a file stream is that used when the stream
    was opened, different names may refer to the same file, e.g. "foo"
    and "./foo".

EXAMPLE
    ; A = blk("alpha");
    ; name(A)
        "alpha"

    ; f = fopen("/tmp/beta", "w")
    ; name(f)
        "/tmp/beta"

    ; name(files(0))
        "(stdin)"

LIMITS

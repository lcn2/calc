NAME
    isblk - whether or not a value is a block

SYNOPSIS
    isblk(val)

TYPES
    val         any

    return      0, 1, or 2

DESCRIPTION
    isblk(val) returns 1 if val is an unnamed block, 2 if val is a
    named block, 0 otherwise.

    Note that a named block B retains its name after its data block is
    freed by rmblk(B).  That a named block B has null data block may be
    tested using sizeof(B);  this returns 0 if and only if the memory
    has been freed.

EXAMPLE
    ; A = blk()
    ; isblk(A)
        1

    ; B = blk("beta")
    ; isblk(B)
        2

    ; isblk(3)
        0

LIMITS
    none

LINK LIBRARY

NAME
    coth - hyperbolic cotangent

SYNOPSIS
    coth(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x           nonzero real
    eps         0 < real < 1, defaults to epsilon()

    return      real

DESCRIPTION
    Calculate the coth of x to a multiple of eps with error less in
    absolute value than .75 * eps.

    coth(x) = (exp(2*x) + 1)/(exp(2*x) - 1)

EXAMPLE
    ; print coth(1, 1e-5), coth(1, 1e-10), coth(1, 1e-15), coth(1, 1e-20)

LIMITS
    0 < eps < 1

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qcoth(NUMBER *x, NUMBER *eps)

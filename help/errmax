NAME
    errmax - return or set maximum error-count before execution stops

SYNOPSIS
    errmax([num])

TYPES
    num         integer

    return      integer

DESCRIPTION
    Without an argument, errmax() returns the current value of an
    internal variable errmax.  Calling errmax(num) returns this value
    but then resets its value to num.  Execution is aborted if
    evaluation of an error value if this makes errcount > errmax
    and errmax is >= 0.

    When errmax is -1, there is no limit on the number of errors.

EXAMPLE
    ; errmax(2)
        20
    ; errcount()
        0
    ; a = 1/0; b = 2 + ""; c = error(27); d = newerror("alpha");
    Error 27 caused errcount to exceed errmax

    ; ## Here global variables c and d were created when compiling the line
    ; ## but execution was aborted before the intended assignments to c and d.

    ; print c, d
    0 0

    ; errmax(-1)
        2

LIMITS
    -1 <= num <= 2147483647

LINK LIBRARY
    none

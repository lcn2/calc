DESCRIPTION
   The expression  mat [index-range-list]  returns a matrix value.
   This may be assigned to one or more lvalues A, B, ... by either

	mat A B ... [index-range-list]

   or

	A = B = ... = mat[index-range-list]

   If a variable is specified by an expression that is not a symbol with
   possibly object element specifiers, the expression should be enclosed
   in parentheses.  For example, parentheses are required in
   mat (A[2]) [3]  and	mat (*p) [3]  but  mat P.x [3] is acceptable.

   When an index-range is specified as integer_1 : integer_2, where
   integer_1 and integer_2 are expressions which evaluate to integers,
   the index-range consists of all integers from the minimum of the
   two integers to the maximum of the two integers.  For example,
   mat[2:5, 0:4] and mat[5:2, 4:0] return the same matrix value.

   If an index-range is an expression which evaluates to an integer,
   the range is as if specified by 0 : integer - 1.  For example,
   mat[4] and mat[0:3] return the same 4-element matrix; mat[-2] and
   mat[-3:0] return the same 4-element matrix.

   If the variable A has a matrix value, then for integer indices
   i_1, i_2, ..., equal in number to the number of ranges specified at
   its creation, and such that each index is in the corresponding range,
   the matrix element associated with those index list is given as an
   lvalue by the expressions A[i_1, i_2, ...].

   The elements of the matrix are stored internally as a linear array
   in which locations are arranged in order of increasing indices.
   For example, in order of location, the six element of A = mat [2,3]
   are

	A[0,0], A[0,1], A[0,2], A[1,0], A[1,,1], A[1,2].

   These elements may also be specified using the double-bracket operator
   with a single integer index as in A[[0]], A[[1]], ..., A[[5]].
   If p is assigned the value &A[0.0], the address of A[[i]] for 0 <= i < 6
   is p + i as long as A exists and a new value is not assigned to A.

   When a matrix is created, each element is initially assigned the
   value zero.	Other values may be assigned then or later using the
   "= {...}" assignment operation.  Thus

	A = {value_0, value_1, ...}

   assigns the values value_0, value_1, ... to the elements A[[0]],
   A[[1]], ...	Any blank "value" is passed over.  For example,

	A = {1, , 2}

   will assign the value 1 to A[[0]], 2 to A[[2]] and leave all other
   elements unchanged.	Values may also be assigned to elements by
   simple assignments, as in A[0,0] = 1, A[0,2] = 2;

   If the index-range is left blank but an initializer list is specified
   as in

	mat A[] = {1, 2 }
	B = mat[] = {1, , 3, }

   the matrix created is one-dimensional.  If the list contains a
   positive number n of values or blanks, the result is as if the
   range were specified by [n], i.e. the range of indices is from
   0 to n - 1.	In the above examples, A is of size 2 with A[0] = 1
   and A[1] = 2;  B is of size 4 with B[0] = 1, B[1] = B[3] = 0,
   B[2] = 3.  The specification mat[] = { } creates the same as mat[1].

   If the index-range is left blank and no initializer list is specified,
   as in  mat C[]  or  C = mat[], the matrix assigned to C has zero
   dimension; this has one element C[].	 To assign a value using "= { ...}"
   at the same time as creating C, parentheses are required as in
   (mat[]) = {value}  or  (mat C[]) = {value}.	Later a value may be
   assigned to C[] by  C[] = value  or	C = {value}.

   The value assigned at any time to any element of a matrix can be of
   any type - number, string, list, matrix, object of previously specified
   type, etc.  For some matrix operations there are of course conditions
   that elements may have to satisfy: for example, addition of matrices
   requires that addition of corresponding elements be possible.
   If an element of a matrix is a structure for which indices or an
   object element specifier is required, an element of that structure is
   referred to by appropriate uses of [ ] or ., and so on if an element
   of that element is required.	 For example, one may have an expressions
   like

		A[1,2][3].alpha[2];

   if A[1,2][3].alpha is a list with at least three elements, A[1,2][3] is
   an object of a type like  obj {alpha, beta}, A[1,2] is a matrix of
   type mat[4] and A is a mat[2,3] matrix.  When an element of a matrix
   is a matrix and the total number of indices does not exceed 4, the
   indices can be combined into one list, e.g. the A[1,2][3] in the
   above example can be shortened to A[1,2,3].	(Unlike C, A[1,2] cannot
   be expressed as A[1][2].)

   The function ismat(V) returns 1 if V is a matrix, 0 otherwise.

   isident(V) returns 1 if V is a square matrix with diagonal elements 1,
   off-diagonal elements zero, or a zero- or one-dimensional matrix with
   every element 1; otherwise zero is returned.	 Thus  isident(V) = 1
   indicates that for  V * A  and  A * V  where A is any matrix of
   for which either product is defined and the elements of A are real
   or complex numbers, that product will equal A.

   If V is matrix-valued, test(V) returns 0 if every element of V tests
   as zero; otherwise 1 is returned.

   The dimension of a matrix A, i.e. the number of index-ranges in the
   initial creation of the matrix, is returned by the function matdim(A).
   For 1 <= i <= matdim(A), the minimum and maximum values for the i-th
   index range are returned by matmin(A, i) and matmax(A,i), respectively.
   The total number of elements in the matrix is returned by size(A).
   The sum of the elements in the matrix is returned by matsum(A).

   The default method of printing matrices is to give a line of information
   about the matrix, and to list on separate lines up to 15 elements,
   the indices and either the value (for numbers, strings, objects) or
   some descriptive information for lists or matrices, etc.
   Numbers are displayed in the current number-printing mode.
   The maximum number of elements to be printed can be assigned
   any nonnegative integer value m by config("maxprint", m).

   Users may define another method of printing matrices by defining a
   function mat_print(M); for example, for a not too big 2-dimensional
   matrix A it is a common practice to use a loop like:

		for (i = matmin(A,1); i <= matmax(A,1); i++) {
			for (j = matmin(A,2); j <= matmax(A,2); j++)
				printf("%8d", A[i,j];
			print;
		}

   The default printing may be restored by

		undefine mat_print;


   The keyword "mat" followed by two or more index-range-lists returns a
   matrix with indices specified by the first list, whose elements are
   matrices as determined by the later index-range-lists.  For
   example  mat[2][3]  is a 2-element matrix, each of whose elements has
   as its value a 3-element matrix.  Values may be assigned to the
   elements of the innermost matrices by nested	 = {...} operations as in

		mat [2][3] = {{1,2,3},{4,5,6}}

   An example of the use of mat with a declarator is

		global mat A B [2,3], C [4]

   This creates, if they do not already exist, three global variables with
   names A, B, C, and assigns to A and B the value mat[2,3] and to C mat[4].

   Some operations are defined for matrices.

   A == B
	Returns 1 if A and B are of the same "shape" and "corresponding"
	elements are equal; otherwise 0 is returned.  Being of the same
	shape means they have the same dimension d, and for each i <= d,

	    matmax(A,i) - matmin(A,i) == matmax(B,i) - matmin(B,i),

	One consequence of being the same shape is that the matrices will
	have the same size.   Elements "correspond" if they have the same
	double-bracket indices; thus A == B implies that A[[i]] == B[[i]]
	for 0 <= i < size(A) == size(B).

   A + B
   A - B
	These are defined A and B have the same shape, the element
	with double-bracket index j being evaluated by A[[j]] + B[[j]] and
	A[[j]] - B[[j]], respectively.	The index-ranges for the results
	are those for the matrix A.

   A[i,j]
	If A is two-dimensional, it is customary to speak of the indices
	i, j in A[i,j] as referring to rows and columns;  the number of
	rows is matmax(A,1) - matmin(A,1) + 1; the number of columns if
	matmax(A,2) - matmin(A,2) + 1.	A matrix is said to be square
	if it is two-dimensional and the number of rows is equal to the
	number of columns.

   A * B
	Multiplication is defined provided certain conditions by the
	dimensions and shapes of A and B are satisfied.	 If both have
	dimension 2 and the column-index-list for A is the same as
	the row-index-list for B, C = A * B is defined in the usual
	way so that for i in the row-index-list of A and j in the
	column-index-list for B,

		C[i,j] =  Sum A[i,k] * B[k,j]

	the sum being over k in the column-index-list of A.  The same
	formula is used so long as the number of columns in A is the same
	as the number of rows in B and k is taken to refer to the offset
	from matmin(A,2) and matmin(B,1), respectively, for A and B.
	If the multiplications and additions required cannot be performed,
	an execution error may occur or the result for C may contain
	one or more error-values as elements.

	If A or B has dimension zero, the result for A * B is simply
	that of multiplying the elements of the other matrix on the
	left by A[] or on the right by B[].

	If both A and B have dimension 1, A * B is defined if A and B
	have the same size; the result has the same index-list as A
	and each element is the product of corresponding elements of
	A and B.  If A and B have the same index-list, this multiplication
	is consistent with multiplication of 2D matrices if A and B are
	taken to represent 2D matrices for which the off-diagonal elements
	are zero and the diagonal elements are those of A and B.
	the real and complex numbers.

	If A is of dimension 1 and B is of dimension 2, A * B is defined
	if the number of rows in B is the same as the size of A.  The
	result has the same index-lists as B; each row of B is multiplied
	on the left by the corresponding element of A.

	If A is of dimension 2 and B is of dimension 1, A * B is defined
	if number of columns in A is the same as the size of A.	 The
	result has the same index-lists as A; each column of A is
	multiplied on the right by the corresponding element of B.

	The algebra of additions and multiplications involving both one-
	and two-dimensional matrices is particularly simple when all the
	elements are real or complex numbers and all the index-lists are
	the same, as occurs, for example, if for some positive integer n,
	all the matrices start as  mat [n]  or	mat [n,n].

    det(A)
	If A is a square, det(A) is evaluated by an algorithm that returns
	the determinant of A if the elements of A are real or complex
	numbers, and if such an A is non-singular, inverse(A) returns
	the inverse of A indexed in the same way as A.	For matrix A of
	dimension 0 or 1, det(A) is defined as the product of the elements
	of A in the order in which they occur in A, inverse(A) returns
	a matrix indexed in the same way as A with each element inverted.


   The following functions are defined to return matrices with the same
	index-ranges as A and the specified operations performed on all
	elements of A.	Here num is an arbitrary complex number (nonzero
	when it is a divisor), int an integer, rnd a rounding-type
	specifier integer, real a real number.

		num * A
		A * num
		A / num
		- A
		conj(A)
		A << int, A >> int
		scale(A, int)
		round(A, int, rnd)
		bround(A, int, rnd)
		appr(A, real, rnd)
		int(A)
		frac(A)
		A // real
		A % real
		A ^ int

   If A and B are one-dimensional of the same size dp(A, B) returns
	their dot-product, i.e. the sum of the products of corresponding
	elements.

   If A and B are one-dimension and of size 3, cp(A, B) returns their
	cross-product.

   randperm(A) returns a matrix indexed the same as A in which the elements
	of A have been randomly permuted.

   sort(A) returns a matrix indexed the same as A in which the elements
	of A have been sorted.

   If A is an lvalue whose current value is a matrix, matfill(A, v)
	assigns the value v to every element of A, and if also, A is
	square, matfill(A, v1, v2) assigns v1 to the off-diagonal elements,
	v2 to the diagonal elements.  To create and assign to A the unit
	n * n matrix, one may use matfill(mat A[n,n], 0, 1).

   For a square matrix A, mattrace(A) returns the trace of A, i.e. the
	sum of the diagonal elements.  For zero- or one-dimensional A,
	mattrace(A) returns the sum of the elements of A.

   For a two-dimensional matrix A, mattrans(A) returns the transpose
	of A, i.e. if A is mat[m,n], it returns a mat[n,m] matrix with
	[i,j] element equal to A[j,i].	For zero- or one-dimensional A,
	mattrace(A) returns a matrix with the same value as A.

   The functions search(A, value, start, end]) and
   rsearch(A, value, start, end]) return the first or last index i
   for which A[[i]] == value and start <= i < end, or if there is
   no such index, the null value.   For further information on default
   values and the use of an "accept" function, see the help files for
   search and rsearch.

   reverse(A) returns a matrix with the same index-lists as A but the
   elements in reversed order.

   The copy and blkcpy functions may be used to copy data to a matrix from
   a matrix or list, or from a matrix to a list.  In copying from a
   matrix to a matrix the matrices need not have the same dimension;
   in effect they are treated as linear arrays.

EXAMPLE
	> obj point {x,y}
	> mat A[5] = {1, 2+3i, "ab", mat[2] = {4,5}. obj point = {6,7}}
	> A
	mat [5] (5 elements, 5 nonzero):
	  [0] = 1
	  [1] = 2+3i
	  [2] = "ab"
	  [3] = mat [2] (2 elements, 2 nonzero)
	  [4] = obj point {6, 7}

	> print A[0], A[1], A[2], A[3][0], A[4].x
	1 2+3i ab 4 6

	> define point_add(a,b) = obj point = {a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y}
	point_add(a,b) defined

	> mat [B] = {8, , "cd", mat[2] = {9,10}, obj point = {11,12}}
	> A + B

	mat [5] (5 elements, 5 nonzero):
	  [0] = 9
	  [1] = 2+3i
	  [2] = "abcd"
	  [3] = mat [2] (2 elements, 2 nonzero)
	  [4] = obj point {17, 19}

	> mat C[2,2] = {1,2,3,4}
	> C^10

	mat [2,2] (4 elements, 4 nonzero):
	  [0,0] = 4783807
	  [0,1] = 6972050
	  [1,0] = 10458075
	  [1,1] = 15241882

	> C^-10

	mat [2,2] (4 elements, 4 nonzero):
	  [0,0] = 14884.650390625
	  [0,1] = -6808.642578125
	  [1,0] = -10212.9638671875
	  [1,1] = 4671.6865234375

	> mat A[4] = {1,2,3,4}, A * reverse(A);

	mat [4] (4 elements, 4 nonzero):
	  [0] = 4
	  [1] = 6
	  [2] = 6
	  [3] = 4

LIMITS
   The theoretical upper bound for the absolute values of indices is
   2^31 - 1, but the size of matrices that can be handled in practice will
   be limited by the availability of memory and what is an acceptable
   runtime.  For example, although it may take only a fraction of a
   second to invert a 10 * 10 matrix, it will probably take about 1000
   times as long to invert a 100 * 100 matrix.

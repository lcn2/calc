NAME
    strcat - concatenate null-terminated strings

SYNOPSIS
    strcat(x1, x2, ...)

TYPES
    x1, x2, ...         strings

    return              string

DESCRIPTION
    strcat(x1, x2, ...) forms a string starting with a copy of
    x1 before the first, if any, null character in x1, followed by the
    initial non-null characters of any later arguments x2, ... The
    length of the resulting string will be the sum of the lengths
    of the component strings considered as null-terminated strings (i.e.
    the lengths as returned by strlen()). The sum function may be used
    to concatenate strings where '\0' is to be considered as an ordinary
    character, either by sum(x1, x2, ...) or sum(list(x1, x2, ...));
    in this case, the size of the resulting string is the sum of the
    sizes of the component strings.

EXAMPLE
    ; A = "abc"; B = "XY"; C = "  ";
    ; print strcat(A, B, C, B, A)
    abcXY  XYabc

LIMITS
    The number of arguments may not to exceed 1024.

LINK LIBRARY

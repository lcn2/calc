NAME
    strncpy - copy a number of characters from head or all of a string
                to head or all of a string

SYNOPSIS
    strncpy(s1, s2, n)

TYPES
    s1          string
    s2          string
    n           nonnegative integer

    return      string

DESCRIPTION
    Let n1 = size(s1), n2 = size(n2), and m = min(n1, n2, n).
    This function replaces the first m characters of s1 by the first
    m characters of s2, and if min(n1, n) > n2, replaces the next
    min(n1,n) - n2 characters of s1 by '\0'. The size of s1 and any
    later characters of s1 are unchanged. The function returns s1, with
    new value.

EXAMPLE
    ; strncpy("abcdef", "xyz", 0) == "abcdef"
    ; strncpy("abcdef", "xyz", 1) == "xbcdef"
    ; strncpy("abcdef", "xyz", 2) == "xycdef"
    ; strncpy("abcdef", "xyz", 3) == "xyzdef"
    ; strncpy("abcdef", "xyz", 4) == "xyz\0ef"
    ; strncpy("abcdef", "xyz", 5) == "xyz\0\0f"
    ; strncpy("ab", "xyz", 3) == "xy"

LIMITS
    none

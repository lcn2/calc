NAME
    acoth - inverse hyperbolic cotangent

SYNOPSIS
    acoth(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x           real, with abs(x) > 1
    eps         0 < real < 1, defaults to epsilon()

    return      real

DESCRIPTION
    Returns the acoth of x to a multiple of eps with error less in
    absolute value than .75 * eps.

    acoth(x) is the real number v for which coth(v) = x.
    It is given by
                acoth(x) = ln((x + 1)/(x - 1))/2

EXAMPLE
    ; print acoth(2, 1e-5), acoth(2, 1e-10), acoth(2, 1e-15), acoth(2, 1e-20)
    0.54931 0.5493061443 0.549306144334055 0.5493061443340548457

LIMITS
    0 < eps < 1

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qacoth(NUMBER *x, NUMBER *eps)

NAME
    den - denominator of a real number

SYNOPSIS
    den(x)

TYPES
    x           real

    return      integer

DESCRIPTION
    For real x, den(x) returns the denominator of x when x is expressed
    in lowest terms with positive denominator.  In calc,
    real values are actually rational values.  Each calc real
    value can be uniquely expressed as:

        n / d

    where:

        n and d are integers
        gcd(n,d) == 1
        d > 0

    The denominator for this n/d is d.

EXAMPLE
    ; print den(7), den(-1.25), den(121/33)
    1 4 3

LIMITS
    none

LINK LIBRARY

NAME
    sum - sum, or sum of defined sums

SYNOPSIS
    sum(x_1, x_2, ...)

TYPES
    x_1, x_2, ...	any

    return		any

DESCRIPTION
    If an argument x_i is a list with elements e_1, e_2, ..., e_n, it
    is treated as if x_i were replaced by e_1, e_2, ..., e_n; this may
    continue recurively if any of the e_j is a list.

    If an argument x_i is an object of type xx, then x_i is replaced by
    xx_sum(x_i) if the function xx_sum() has been defined.  If the
    type xx has been defined by:

		obj xx = {x, y, z},

    an appropriate definition of xx_sum(a) is sometimes a.x + a.y + a.z.
    sum(a) then returns the sum of the elements of a.

    If x_i has the null value, it is ignored.  Thus, sum(a, , b, , c)
    will return the same as sum(a, b, c).

    Assuming the above replacements, and that the x_1, x_2, ..., are
    of types for which addition is defined, sum(x_1, x_2, ...) returns
    the sum of the arguments.

EXAMPLE
    > print sum(2), sum(5, 3, 7, 2, 9), sum(3.2, -0.5, 8.7, -1.2, 2.5)
    2 26 12.7

    > print sum(list(3,5), 7, list(6, list(7,8), 2))
    38


    > obj point {x, y}
    > define point_add(a,b) = obj point = {a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y}
    > obj point A = {1, 5}
    > obj point B = {1, 4}
    > obj point C = {3, 3}
    > print sum(A, B, C)
    obj point {5, 12}

    > define point_sum(a) = a.x
    > print sum(A, B, C)
    5

LIMITS
    The number of arguments is not to exceed 100.

LINK LIBRARY

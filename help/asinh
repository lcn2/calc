NAME
    asinh - inverse hyperbolic sine

SYNOPSIS
    asinh(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x           real
    eps         0 < real < 1, defaults to epsilon()

    return      real

DESCRIPTION
    Returns the asinh of x to a multiple of eps with error less in
    absolute value than .75 * eps.

    asinh(x) is the real number v for which sinh(v) = x.  It is given by

                asinh(x) = ln(x + sqrt(1 + x^2))

EXAMPLE
    ; print asinh(2, 1e-5), asinh(2, 1e-10), asinh(2, 1e-15), asinh(2, 1e-20)
    1.44363 1.4436354752 1.44363547517881 1.44363547517881034249

LIMITS
    0 < eps < 1

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qasinh(NUMBER *x, NUMBER *eps)

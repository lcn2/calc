NAME
    seed - return a value that may be used to seed a pseudo-random generator

SYNOPSIS
    seed()

TYPES
    return      integer

DESCRIPTION
    Generate a pseudo-random seed based on a collection of system and process
    information.  The seed() builtin function returns a value:

                0 <= seed < 2^64

    IMPORTANT WARNING:

        It should be pointed out that the information collected by seed
        is almost certainly non-chaotic.  This function is likely not
        suitable for applications (such as cryptographic applications)
        where the unpredictability of seeds is critical.

    Given the above warning, this builtin function produces a seed that is
    suitable for most applications that desire a different pseudo-random
    sequence each time they are run.

    The return value of this builtin function should NOT be considered
    a random or pseudo-random value.  The return value could be used
    as an argument to seed functions such as srand() or srandom().

EXAMPLE
    ; print srand(seed())
    RAND state

    ; print srandom(seed())
    RANDOM state

LIMITS
    none

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *pseudo_seed(void)

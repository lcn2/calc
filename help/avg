NAME
    avg - average (arithmetic) mean of values

SYNOPSIS
    avg(x_1, x_2, ...)

TYPES
    x_1, ...    arithmetic or list

    return      as determined by types of items averaged

DESCRIPTION
    If there are n non-list arguments x_1, x_2, ..., x_n,
    for which the required additions and division by n are defined,
    avg(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) returns the value of:

        (x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n)/n.

    If the x_i are real, the result will be a real number; if the
    x_i are real or complex numbers, the result will be a real or complex
    number.  If the x_i are summable matrices the result will be a matrix
    of the same size (e.g. if the x_i are all 3 x 4 matrices with real
    entries, the result will be a 3 x 4 matrix with real entries).

    If an argument x_i is list-valued, e.g. list(y_1, y_2, ...), this
    is treated as contributing y_1, y_2, ... to the list of items to
    be averaged.

EXAMPLE
    ; print avg(1,2,3,4,5), avg(list(1,2,3,4,5)), avg(1,2,list(3,4,5))
    3 3 3

    ; mat x[2,2] = {1,2,3,4}
    ; mat y[2,2] = {1,2,4,8}
    ; avg(x,y)

    mat [2,2] (4 elements, 4 nonzero):
        [0,0] = 1
        [0,1] = 2
        [1,0] = 3.5
        [1,1] = 6

LIMITS
   The number of arguments is not to exceed 1024.

LINK LIBRARY
    none

NAME
    issq - whether a value is a square

SYNOPSIS
    issq(x)

TYPES
    x           real

    return      int

DESCRIPTION
    Determine if x is a square.  If there exists integers a, b such that:

        x == a^2 / b^2          (b != 0)

    return 1, otherwise return 0.

    Note that issq() works on rational values, so:

        issq(25/16) == 1

    If you want to test for prefect square integers, you need to exclude
    non-integer values before you test:

        isint(curds) && issq(curds)

EXAMPLE
    ; print issq(25), issq(3), issq(0)
    1 0 1

    ; print issq(4/25), issq(-4/25), issq(pi())
    1 0 0

LIMITS
    none

LINK LIBRARY
    BOOL qissquare(NUMBER *x)
    BOOL zissquare(ZVALUE x)

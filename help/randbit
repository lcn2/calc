    randbit - subtractive 100 shuffle pseudo-random number generator

SYNOPSIS
    randbit([x])

TYPES
    x           integer

    return      integer

DESCRIPTION
    If x > 0, randbit(x) returns a pseudo-random integer in [0, 2^x),
    i.e. the same as rand(2^x).  If the integer returned is

            b_1 * 2^(x-1) + b_2 * 2^(x-2) + ... + b_n,

    where each b_i is 0 or 1, then b_1, b_2, ..., b_n may be
    considered as a sequence of x random bits.

    If x <= 0, randbit(x) causes the random-number generator to skip
    abs(x) bits, and returns abs(x).

    If x is omitted, it is assumed to have the value of 1.

    See the rand() help page for details on the subtractive 100 shuffle
    pseudo-random number generator.

EXAMPLE
    ; print srand(0), randbit(20), randbit(20), randbit(20), randbit(20)
    RAND state 817647 476130 944201 822573

    ; print srand(0), randbit(-20), randbit(20), randbit(-20), randbit(20)
    RAND state 20 476130 20 822573

LIMITS
    x != 0

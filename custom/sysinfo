NAME
    sysinfo - return a calc #define value

SYNOPSIS
    custom("sysinfo" [, infoname]);

TYPES
    infoname    string or int

    return      int, string or null

DESCRIPTION

    This custom function will return the value certain selected #define
    values.  The infoname arg must be a string that matches the given
    #define name.  For convenience, the case infoname does not matter,
    so "baseb" and "BASEB" refer to the same #define value.

    The return value is either an integer or a string depending on
    the type of #define selected.  If infoname is unknown, NULL is returned.

    If no infoname is given then a list of infonames and meanings
    are printed.  In this case, null is returned.

    If infoname is a number, then it is interpreted as follows:

        0       print all infonames and meanings        (same as no infoname)
        1       print all infonames and values
        2       print all infoname meanings and values

EXAMPLE
    > custom("sysinfo", "baseb")
            32

    > custom("sysinfo")
    ... a list of infonames and meanings are printed ...
    > custom("sysinfo", 0)
    ... a list of infonames and meanings are printed ...

    > custom("sysinfo", 1)

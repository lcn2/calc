NAME
    errcount - return or set the internal error count

SYNOPSIS
    errcount([num])

TYPES
    num         integer

    return      integer

DESCRIPTION
    An internal variable keeps count of the number of functions
    evaluating to an error value either internally or by a call to
    error() or newerror().

    The errcount() with no args returns the current error count.  Calling
    errcount(num) returns the current error count and resets it to num.

    If the count exceeds the current value of errmax, execution is aborted
    with a message displaying the errno for the error.

    If an error value is assigned to a variable as in:

                        infty = 1/0;

    then a function returning that variable does not contribute to
    errcount.

EXAMPLE
    ; ## NOTE: Your output may vary:

    ; errmax(10)
            0
    ; errcount()
            0
    ; a = 1/0; b = 2 + ""; c = error(27); d = newerror("a");
    ; print errcount(), a, errcount(), errmax();
    4 Error E_DIVBYZERO 4 10

LIMITS
    0 <= num < 2^32

LINK LIBRARY
    none

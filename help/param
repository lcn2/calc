NAME
    param - value of argument in a user-function call

SYNOPSIS
    param([n])

TYPES
    n		nonnegative integer

    return	any

DESCRIPTION
    The function param(n) can be used only within the body of the
    definition of a function.

    If that function is f()

	[[ which may have been defined with named arguments as in f(x,y,z))

    and either the number of arguments or the value of an argument
    in an anticipated call to f() is to be used, the number of
    arguments in that call will then be returned by:

	param(0)

    and the value of the n-th argument by:

	param(n)

    Note that unlike the argv() builtin, param(1) is the 1st parameter
    and param(param(0) is the last.

EXAMPLE
    > define f() {
    >>	local n, v = 0;
    >>	for (n = 1; n <= param(0); n++)
    >>		v += param(n)^2;
    >>	return v;
    >> }

    > print f(), f(1), f(1,2), f(1,2,3)
    0 1 5 14

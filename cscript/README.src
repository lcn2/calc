calc shell script examples
--------------------------

These calc shell scripts are provided because they serve as examples of
how use the calc language, and/or because the authors thought them to
be useful!

Please note that calc shell scripts must start with the line:

    #!/usr/local/src/bin/calc/calc -q -f

The above line MUST start in column 1 of the first line.   The first line
must also end in -f.  The -q is optional, but is recommended to disable
the processing of calc startup scripts.

Also please note that single # shell line comments are not supported in calc.
Comments must be /* c-like comment */ or start with a double ## symbol.

This is the correct way to form a calc shell script:

    #!/usr/local/src/bin/calc/calc -q -f

    /* a correct comment */
    ## another correct comment
    ### two or more together is also a comment
    /*
     * another correct comment
     */
    print "2+2 =", 2+2;	## yet another comment

The first argument after the path to calc executable must be an -S.
The next arguments are optional.  The -q is often recommended because
it will disable the processing of the startup scripts.

For more informaton about calc command lines, see "help usage".

This next example WRONG:

    #!/usr/local/src/bin/calc/calc -q

    # This is not a calc calc comment because it has only a single #
    # You must to start comments with ## or /*
    # is is also wrong because the first line does not end in -f
    print "This example has invalid comments"

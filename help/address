NAME
    & - address operator

SYNOPSIS
    &X

TYPES
    X		expression specifying an octet, lvalue, string or number

    return	pointer

DESCRIPTION
    &X returns the address at which information for determining the current
    value of X is stored.  After an assignment as in p = &X, the
    value of X is accessible by *p so long as the connection between p
    and the value is not broken by relocation of the information or by the
    value ceasing to exist.  Use of an address after the connection
    is broken is unwise since the calculator may use that address for other
    purposes; the consequences of attempting to write data to, or
    otherwise accessing, such a vacated address may be catastrophic.

    An octet is normally expressed by B[i] where B is a block and
    0 <= i < sizeof(B).	 &B[i] then returns the address at which this
    octet is located until the block is freed or relocated.  Freeing
    of an unnamed block B occurs when a new value is assigned to B or
    when B ceases to exist; a named block B is freed by blkfree(B).
    A block is relocated when an operation like copying to B requires
    a change of sizeof(B).

    An lvalue may be expressed by an identifier for a variable, or by
    such an identifier followed by one or more qualifiers compatible with
    the type of values associated with the variable and earlier qualifiers.
    If an identifier A specifies a global or static variable, the address
    &A is permanently associated with that variable.  For a local variable
    or function parameter A, the association of the variable with &A
    is limited to each occasion when the function is called.  If X specifies a
    component or element of a matrix or object, connection of
    &X with that component or element depends only on the continued existence
    of the matrix or object.  For example, after

			> mat A[3]

    the addresses &A[0], &A[1], &A[2] locate the three elements
    of the matrix specified by A until another value is assigned to A, etc.
    Note one difference from C in that &A[0] is not the same as A.

    An element of a list has a fixed address while the list exists and
    the element is not removed by pop(), remove(), or delete(); the index
    of the element changes if an element is pushed onto the list, or if
    earlier elements are popped or deleted.

    Elements of an association have fixed addresses so long as the association
    exists.  If A[a,b,...] has not been defined for the association A,
    &A[a,b,...] returns the constant address of a particular null value.

    Some other special values have fixed addresses; e.g. the old value (.).

    Some arithmetic operations are defined for addresses but these should
    be used only for octets or components of a matrix or object where the
    results refer to octets in the same block or existing components of the
    same matrix or object.  For example, immediately after

			> mat A[10]
			> p = &A[5]

    it is permitted to use expressions like p + 4, p - 5, p++ .

    Strings defined literally have fixed addresses, e.g., after

			> p = &"abc"
			> A = "abc"

    the address &*A of the value of A will be equal to p.

    Except in cases like strcat(A, "") when *A identified with a literal
    string as above, definitions of string values using strcat() or substr()
    will copy the relevant strings to newly allocated addresses which will
    be useable only while the variables retain these defined values.
    For example, after

			> B = C = strcat("a", "bc");

    &*B and &*C will be different.  If p is defined by p = &*B, p should
    not be used after a new value is assigned to B, or B ceases to exist,
    etc.

    When compilation of a function encounters for the first time a particular
    literal number or the result of simple arithmetic operations (like +, -, *,
    or /) on literal numbers, that number is assigned to a particular
    address which is then used for later similar occurrences of that number
    so long as the number remains associated with at least one function or
    lvalue.  For example, after

			> x = 27;
			> y = 3 * 9;
			> define f(a) = 27 + a;

    the three occurrences of 27 have the same address which may be displayed
    by any of &27, &*x, &*y and &f(0).	If x and y are assigned
    other values and f is redefined or undefined and the 27 has not been
    stored elsewhere (e.g. as the "old value" or in another function
    definition or as an element in an association), the address assigned at
    the first occurrence of 27 will be freed and calc may later use it for
    another number.

    When a function returns a number value, that number value is usually
    placed at a newly allocated address, even if an equal number is stored
    elsewhere.	For example calls to f(a), as defined above, with the same
    non-zero value for a will be assigned to different addresses as can be
    seen from printing &*A, &*B, &*C after

		> A = f(2); B = f(2); C = f(2);

    (the case of f(0) is exceptional since 27 + 0 simply copies the 27
    rather than creating a new number value).  Here it is clearly more
    efficient to use

		> A = B = C = f(2);

    which, not only performs the addition in f() only once, but stores the
    number values for A, B and C at the same address.

    Whether a value V is a pointer and if so, its type, is indicated by the
    value returned by isptr(V): 1, 2, 3, 4 for octet-, value-, string-
    and number-pointer respectively, and 0 otherwise.

    The output when addresses are printed consists of a description (o_ptr,
    v_ptr, s_ptr, n_ptr) followed by : and the address printed in
    %p format.

    Iteration of & is not permitted; &&X causes a "non-variable operand"
    scan error.

EXAMPLE
    Addresses for particular systems may differ from those displayed here.

    > mat A[3]
    > B = blk()

    > print &A, &A[0], &A[1]
    v-ptr: 1400470d0 v-ptr: 140044b70 v-ptr: 140044b80

    > print &B, &B[0], &B[1]
    v-ptr: 140047130 o-ptr: 140044d00 o-ptr: 140044d01

    > a = A[0] = 27
    > print &*a, &*A[0]. &27
    n_ptr: 14003a850 n_ptr: 14003a850 n_ptr: 14003a850

    > a = A[0] = "abc"
    > print &*a, &*A[0], &"abc"
    s_ptr: 14004cae0 s_ptr: 14004cae0 s_ptr: 14004cae0

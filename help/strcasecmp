NAME
    strcasecmp - compare two strings, case independent

SYNOPSIS
    strcasecmp(s1, s2)

TYPES
    s1          string
    s2          string

    return      integer (1, 0 or -1)

DESCRIPTION
    Let n1 = size(s1), n2 = size(s2) and m = min(n1, n2).
    This function compares up to m values of consecutive characters
    in the strings s1 and s2. If an inequality is encountered, the
    function returns 1 or -1 according as the greater character is
    in s1 or s2. If there has been no inequality, the function
    returns 1, 0, or -1 according as n1 is greater than, equal to,
    or less than n2.
    Note that null characters within the strings are included in the
    comparison.
    This function is case independent

EXAMPLE
    strcasecmp("ab", "aBc") == -1
    strcasecmp("abc", "aBb") == 1
    strcasecmp("abc", "abc") == 0
    strcasecmp("abc", "aBc") == 0
    strcasecmp("abc", "aBd") == -1
    strcasecmp("abc\0", "aBc") == 1
    strcasecmp("a\0b", "A\0c") == -1

LIMITS
    none

LINK LIBRARY

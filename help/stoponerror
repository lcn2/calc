NAME
    stoponerror - controls when / if calc stops calculations based on errors

SYNOPSIS
    stoponerror([n])

TYPES
    n           integer

    return      null value or error value

DESCRIPTION

    The stoponerror controls when or if calc stops based on the
    number of errors:

        n == -1         do not stop
        n == 0          stop on error unless calc was invoked with -c
        n > 0           stop when n errors are encountered

    When no arguments are given, stoponerror() returns the current
    stoponerror value.  When 1 argument is given, stoponerror() returns
    the previous stoponerror value.

    See help errcount for information on the current error count.
    See help errmax for the maximum error-count before execution stops.

EXAMPLE
    ; stoponerror()
        0

LIMITS

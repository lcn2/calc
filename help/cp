NAME
    cp - cross product of two 3 element vectors

SYNOPSIS
    cp(x, y)

TYPES
    x, y        1-dimensional matrices with 3 elements

    return      1-dimensional matrix with 3 elements

DESCRIPTION
    Calculate the product of two 3 1-dimensional matrices.
    If x has elements (x0, x1, x2), and y has elements (y0, y1, y2),
    cp(x,y) returns the matrix of type [0:2] with elements:

        {x1 * y2 - x2 * y1, x3 * y1 - x1 * y3, x1 * y2 - x2 * y1}

EXAMPLE
    ; mat x[3] = {2,3,4}
    ; mat y[3] = {3,4,5}
    ; print cp(x,y)

    mat [3] (3 elements, 3 nonzero):
      [0] = -1
      [1] = 2
      [2] = -1

LIMITS
    The components of the matrices are to be of types for which the
    required algebraic operations have been defined.

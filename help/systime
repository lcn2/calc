NAME
    systime - kernel CPU time used by the current process

SYNOPSIS
    systime()

TYPES
    return	nonnegative real

DESCRIPTION
    In POSIX based systems, this function will return the CPU seconds
    used by the current process while in kernel mode executing kernel
    code on behalf of the current process.  Time spent by the current
    process executing user code (such as performing computation on
    behalf of calc) is not counted.

    On non-POSIX based systems, this function will always return 0.
    In particular, most MS windows based systems do not have the required
    POSIX system call and so this function will always return 0.

EXAMPLE
    The result for this example will depend on the speed of the CPU
    and precision of the operating CPU time accounting sub-system:

    ; t = systime();
    ; system("true"),
    ; systime() - t;
	.001

LIMITS
    On non-POSIX based systems, this function always returns 0.

LINK LIBRARY
    none

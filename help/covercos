NAME
    covercos - coversed trigonometric cosine

SYNOPSIS
    covercos(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x           number (real or complex)
    eps         0 < real < 1, defaults to epsilon()

    return      number

DESCRIPTION
    Calculate the coversed trigonometric cosine of x to a multiple of eps with error less in
    absolute value than .75 * eps.

    This function is sometimes called cvc, or covercosine, is equivalent to:

        covercos(x) = 1 + sin(x)

EXAMPLE
    ; print covercos(1/2), covercos(5/7), covercos(42/7)
    1.47942553860420300027 1.6550778971785185742 0.72058450180107412719

    ; print covercos(1, 1e-5), covercos(1, 1e-10), covercos(1, 1e-15), covercos(1, 1e-20)

    ; print covercos(2 + 3i, 1e-5), covercos(2 + 3i, 1e-10)
    10.1545-4.16891i 10.1544991469-4.16890696i

    ; pi = pi(1e-20)
    ; print covercos(pi/6), covercos(pi/2), covercos(pi)
    1.5 2 1

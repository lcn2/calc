Calc is open source. Contributions of code are welcome.

In order to consider integrating your contributions, we need:

    * your changes applied agsinst the top of the calc master branch:

          https://github.com/lcn2/calc/

    * new help files or help file patches, if applicable (documentation)

    * Update CHANGES file (brief description of what it does)

    * regress.cal test patch as needed

If you add functionality to calc, please be sure to modify
Makefiles, help files, cal/regress.cal test code as well.
Regression test cases are vital to maintaining calc's level
of correctness and helps us avoid code bug regression.

The best way contribute to calc bug is to generate calc
GitHub pull request against the calc GitHub repo:

    https://github.com/lcn2/calc/pulls

Please be patient as we cannot always respond pull requests quickly.

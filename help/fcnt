NAME
    fcnt - count of number of times a specified integer divides an integer

SYNOPSIS
    fcnt(x,y)

TYPES
    x           integer
    y           integer

    return      non-negative integer

DESCRIPTION
    If x is nonzero and abs(y) > 1, fcnt(x,y) returns the greatest
    non-negative n for which y^n is a divisor of x.  In particular,
    zero is returned if x is not divisible by y.

    If x is zero or if y = -1, 0 or 1, fcnt(x,y) is defined to be zero.

EXAMPLE
    ; print fcnt(7,4), fcnt(24,4), fcnt(48,4)
    0 1 2

LIMITS
    none

LINK LIBRARY
    long zfacrem(ZVALUE x, ZVALUE y, ZVALUE *rem)

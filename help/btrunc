NAME
    btrunc - truncate a value to a number of binary places

SYNOPSIS
    btrunc(x [,plcs])

TYPES
    x		real
    plcs	integer, defaults to zero

    return	real

DESCRIPTION
    Truncate x to plcs binary places, rounding if necessary towards zero,
    i.e. btrunc(x, plcs) is a multiple of 2^-plcs and the remainder
    x - btrunc(x, plcs) is either zero or has the same sign as x and
    absolute value less than 2^-plcs.  Here plcs may be positive, zero or
    negative.

    Except that it is defined only for real x, btrunc(x, plcs) is equivalent
    to bround(x, plcs, 2).  btrunc(x,0) and btrunc(x) are equivalent to
    int(x).

EXAMPLE
    > print btrunc(pi()), btrunc(pi(), 10)
    3 3.140625

    > print btrunc(3.3), btrunc(3.7), btrunc(3.3, 2), btrunc(3.7, 2)
    3 3 3.25 3.5

    > print btrunc(-3.3), btrunc(-3.7), btrunc(-3.3, 2), btrunc(-3.7, 2)
    -3 -3 -3.25 -3.5

    > print btrunc(55.123, -4), btrunc(-55.123, -4)
    48 -48

LIMITS
    abs(j) < 2^31

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qbtrunc(NUMBER *x, *j)

NAME
    append - append one or more values to end of list

SYNOPSIS
    append(x, y_0, y_1, ...)

TYPES
    x           lvalue whose value is a list
    y_0, ...    any

    return      null value

DESCRIPTION
    If after evaluation of y_0, y_1, ..., x is a list with contents
    (x_0, x_1, ...), then after append(x, y_0, y_1, ...), x has
    contents (x_0, x_1, ..., y_0, y_1, ...).

    If after evaluation of y_0, y_1, ..., x has size n,
    append(x, y_0, y_1, ...) is equivalent to insert(x, n, y_0, y_1, ...).

EXAMPLE
    ; x = list(2,3,4)
    ; append(x, 5, 6)
    ; print x

    list (5 elements, 5 nonzero):
      [[0]] = 2
      [[1]] = 3
      [[2]] = 4
      [[3]] = 5
      [[4]] = 6

    ; append(x, pop(x), pop(x))
    ; print x

    list (5 elements, 5 nonzero):
      [[0]] = 4
      [[1]] = 5
      [[2]] = 6
      [[3]] = 2
      [[4]] = 3

    ; append(x, (remove(x), 7))
    ; print x

    list (5 elements, 5 nonzero):
      [[0]] = 4
      [[1]] = 5
      [[2]] = 6
      [[3]] = 2
      [[4]] = 7

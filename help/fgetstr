NAME
    fgetstr - read the next null-terminated string from a file

SYNOPSIS
    fgetstr(fs)

TYPES
    fs		file stream open for reading

    return	string, null or error value

DESCRIPTION
    If the stream is at end of file, the null value is returned.

    If the stream cannot be read, an error value is returned.

    Otherwise the function returns the string of characters from the
    current file position to the first null character ('\0') (the file
    position for further reading then being immediately after the '\0'),
    or if no null character is encountered, the string of characters to
    the end of file (the string as usual being terminated by '\0').

    If the stream being read is from stdin (i.e. files(0)), the
    characters entered are not displayed and reading ends when a '\0' is
    entered (on many terminals this is by ctrl-@).

EXAMPLE
    > f = fopen("/tmp/junk", "w")
    > fputstr(f, "  Alpha    Beta ", "", "Gamma\n\tDelta")
    > freopen(f, "r")
    > fgetstr(f)
	"  Alpha    Beta "
    > fgetstr(f)
	""
    > fgetstr(f)
	"Gamma
	Delta"
    > fgetstr(f)
    >

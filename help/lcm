NAME
    lcm - least common multiple of a set of rational numbers

SYNOPSIS
    lcm(x1, x2, ...)

TYPES
    x1, x2, ... rational number

    return      rational number

DESCRIPTION
    Compute the least common multiple of one or more rational numbers.

    If no xi is zero, lcm(x1, x2, ...) is the least positive number v
    for which v is a multiple of each xi.  If at least one xi is zero,
    the lcm is zero.

EXAMPLE
    ; print lcm(12, -24, 30), lcm(9/10, 11/5, 4/25), lcm(2)
    -120 79.2 2

LIMITS
    The number of arguments is not to exceed 1024.

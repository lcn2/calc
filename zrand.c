/*
 * AN OVERVIEW OF THE FUNCTIONS:
 *
 * This module contains an Subtractive 100 shuffle generator wrapped inside
 * of a shuffle generator.
 *
 *      We refer to this generator as the s100 generator.
 *
 *      rand    - s100 shuffle generator
 *      srand   - seed the s100 shuffle generator
 *
 *      This generator has two distinct parts, the s100 generator
 *      and the shuffle generator.
 *
 *      The subtractive 100 generator is described in Knuth's "The Art of
 *      Computer Programming - Seminumerical Algorithms", Vol 2, 3rd edition
 *      (1998), Section 3.6, page 186, formula (2).
 *
 *      The "use only the first 100 our of every 1009" is described in
 *      Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming - Seminumerical Algorithms",
 *      Vol 2, 3rd edition (1998), Section 3.6, page 188".
 *
 *      The period and other properties of this generator make it very
 *      useful to 'seed' other generators.
 *
 *      The shuffle generator is described in Knuth's "The Art of Computer
 *      Programming - Seminumerical Algorithms", Vol 2, 3rd edition (1998),
 *      Section 3.2.2, page 34, Algorithm B.
 *
 *      The shuffle generator is fast and serves as a fairly good standard
 *      pseudo-random generator.   If you need a fast generator and do not
 *      need a cryptographically strong one, this generator is likely to do
 *      the job.
 *
 *      The shuffle generator is feed values by the subtractive 100 process.
 *
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * GOALS:
 *
 * The goals of this package are:
 *
 *      all magic numbers are explained
 *
 *          I distrust systems with constants (magic numbers) and tables
 *          that have no justification.  I believe that I have
 *          done my best to justify all of the magic numbers used.
 *
 *       full documentation
 *
 *          You have this source file, plus background publications,
 *          what more could you ask?
 *
 *      large selection of seeds
 *
 *          Seeds are not limited to a small number of bits.  A seed
 *          may be of any size.
 *
 *      the strength of the generators may be tuned to meet the need
 *
 *          By using the appropriate seed and other arguments, one may
 *          increase the strength of the generator to suit the need of
 *          the application.  One does not have just a few levels.
 *
 * Even though I have done my best to implement a good system, you still
 * must use these routines your own risk.
 *
 * Share and enjoy!  :-)

/*
 * ON THE GENERATORS:
 *
 * The subtractive 100 generator has a good period, and is fast.  It is
 * reasonable as generators go, though there are better ones available.
 * The shuffle generator has a very good period, and is fast.  It is
 * fairly good as generators go, particularly when it is feed reasonably
 * random numbers.  Because of this, we use feed values from the subtractive
 * 100 process into the shuffle generator.
 *
 * The s100 generator uses 2 tables:
 *
 *      subtractive table - 100 entries of 64 bits used by the subtractive 100
 *                          part of the s100 generator
 *
 *      shuffle table - 256 entries of 64 bits used by the shuffle
 *                      part of the s100 generator and feed by the
 *                      subtractive table.
 *
 * Casual direct use of the shuffle generator may be acceptable.  If one
 * desires cryptographically strong random numbers, or if one is paranoid,
 * one should use the Blum generator instead (see zrandom.c).
 *
 * The s100 generator as the following calc interfaces:
 *
 *   rand(min,beyond)           (where min < beyond)
 *
 *      Print an s100 generator random value over interval [a,b).
 *
 *   rand()
 *
 *      Same as rand(0, 2^64).  Print 64 bits.
 *
 *   rand(lim)                  (where 0 > lim)
 *
 *      Same as rand(0, lim).
 *
 *   randbit(x)                 (where x > 0)
 *
 *      Same as rand(0, 2^x).  Print x bits.
 *
 *   randbit(skip)              (where skip < 0)
 *
 *      Skip random bits and return the bit skip count (-skip).
 */

/*
 * INITIALIZATION AND SEEDS:
 *
 * All generators come already seeded with precomputed initial constants.
 * Thus, it is not required to seed a generator before using it.
 *
 * The s100 generator may be initialized and seeded via srand().
 *
 * Using a seed of '0' will reload generators with their initial states.
 *
 *      srand(0)        restore subtractive 100 generator to the initial state
 *
 * The above single arg calls are fairly fast.
 *
 * Optimal seed range for the s100 generator:
 *
 *      There is no limit on the size of a seed.  On the other hand,
 *      extremely large seeds require large tables and long seed times.
 *      Using a seed in the range of [2^64, 2^64 * 100!) should be
 *      sufficient for most purposes.  An easy way to stay within this
 *      range to to use seeds that are between 21 and 178 digits, or
 *      64 to 588 bits long.
 *
 *      To help make the generator produced by seed S, significantly
 *      different from S+1, seeds are scrambled prior to use.  The
 *      function randreseed64() maps [0,2^64) into [0,2^64) in a 1-to-1
 *      and onto fashion.
 *
 *      The purpose of the randreseed64() is not to add security.  It
 *      simply helps remove the human perception of the relationship
 *      between the seed and the production of the generator.
 *
 *      The randreseed64() process does not reduce the security of the
 *      generators.  Every seed is converted into a different unique seed.
 *      No seed is ignored or favored.
 *
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * srand(seed)
 *
 *    Seed the s100 generator.
 *
 *    seed != 0:
 *    ---------
 *      Any buffered random bits are flushed.  The subtractive table is loaded
 *      with the default subtractive table.  The low order 64 bits of seed is
 *      xor-ed against each table value.  The subtractive table is shuffled
 *      according to seed/2^64.
 *
 *      The following calc code produces the same effect:
 *
 *          (* reload default subtractive table xor-ed with low 64 seed bits *)
 *          seed_xor = seed & ((1<<64)-1);
 *          for (i=0; i < 100; ++i) {
 *              subtractive[i] = xor(default_subtractive[i], seed_xor);
 *          }
 *
 *          (* shuffle the subtractive table *)
 *          seed >>= 64;
 *          for (i=100; seed > 0 && i > 0; --i) {
 *              quomod(seed, i+1, seed, j);
 *              swap(subtractive[i], subtractive[j]);
 *          }
 *
 *      Seed must be >= 0.  All seed values < 0 are reserved for future use.
 *
 *      The subtractive 100 pointers are reset to subtractive[36] and
 *      subtractive[99].  Last the shuffle table is loaded with successive
 *      values from the subtractive 100 generator.
 *
 *    seed == 0:
 *    ---------
 *      Restore the initial state and modulus of the s100 generator.
 *      After this call, the s100 generator is restored to its initial
 *      state after calc started.
 *
 *      The subtractive 100 pointers are reset to subtractive[36] and
 *      subtractive[99].  Last the shuffle table is loaded with successive
 *      values from the subtractive 100 generator.
 *
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * srand(mat100)
 *
 *    Seed the s100 generator.
 *
 *    Any buffered random bits are flushed.  The subtractive table with the
 *    first 100 entries of the array mat100, mod 2^64.
 *
 *    The subtractive 100 pointers are reset to subtractive[36] and
 *    subtractive[99].  Last the shuffle table is loaded with successive
 *    values from the subtractive 100 generator.
 *
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * srand()
 *
 *    Return current s100 generator state.  This call does not alter
 *    the generator state.
 *
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * srand(state)
 *
 *    Restore the s100 state and return the previous state.  Note that
 *    the argument state is a rand state value (isrand(state) is true).
 *    Any internally buffered random bits are restored.
 *
 *    The states of the s100 generators can be saved by calling the seed
 *    function with no arguments, and later restored by calling the seed
 *    functions with that same return value.
 *
 *      rand_state = srand();
 *      ... generate random bits ...
 *      prev_rand_state = srand(rand_state);
 *      ... generate the same random bits ...
 *      srand() == prev_rand_state;             (* is true *)
 *
 *    Saving the state just after seeding a generator and restoring it later
 *    as a very fast way to reseed a generator.

/*
 * TRUTH IN ADVERTISING:
 *
 * A "truth in advertising" issue is the use of the term
 * 'pseudo-random'.  All deterministic generators are pseudo random.
 * This is opposed to true random generators based on some special
 * physical device.
 *
 * A final "truth in advertising" issue deals with how the magic numbers
 * found in this file were generated.  Detains can be found in the
 * various functions, while a overview can be found in the "SOURCE FOR
 * MAGIC NUMBERS" section below.
 */

/*
 * SOURCE OF MAGIC NUMBERS:
 *
 * Most of the magic constants used on this file ultimately are
 * based on LavaRnd.  LavaRnd produced them via a cryptographic
 * of the digitization of chaotic system that consisted of a noisy
 * digital camera and 6 Lava Lite(R) lamps.
 *
 *      BTW: Lava Lite(R) is a trademark of Haggerty Enterprises, Inc.
 *
 * The first 100 groups of 64 bit bits were used to initialize init_s100.slot.
 *
 * The function, randreseed64(), uses 2 primes to scramble 64 bits
 * into 64 bits.  These primes were also extracted from the Rand
 * Book of Random Numbers.  See randreseed64() for details.
 *
 * The shuffle table size is longer than the 100 entries recommended
 * by Knuth.  We use a power of 2 shuffle table length so that the
 * shuffle process can select a table entry from a new subtractive 100
 * value by extracting its low order bits.  The value 256 is convenient
 * in that it is the size of a byte which allows for easy extraction.
 *
 * We use the upper byte of the subtractive 100 value to select the shuffle
 * table entry because it allows all of 64 bits to play a part in the
 * entry selection.  If we were to select a lower 8 bits in the 64 bit
 * value, carries that propagate above our 8 bits would not impact the
 * s100 generator output.
 *
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * FOR THE PARANOID:
 *
 * The truly paranoid might suggest that my claims in the MAGIC NUMBERS
 * section are a lie intended to entrap people.  Well they are not, but
 * if you that paranoid why would you use a non-cryptographically strong
 * pseudo-random number generator in the first place?  You would be
 * better off using the random() builtin function.
 *
 * The two constants that were picked from the Rand Book of Random Numbers
 * The random numbers from the Rand Book of Random Numbers can be
 * verified by anyone who obtains the book.  As these numbers were
 * created before I (Landon Curt Noll) was born (you can look up
 * my birth record if you want), I claim to have no possible influence
 * on their generation.
 *
 * There is a very slight chance that the electronic copy of the
 * Rand Book of Random Numbers that I was given access to differs
 * from the printed text.  I am willing to provide access to this
 * electronic copy should anyone wants to compare it to the printed text.
 *
 * When using the s100 generator, one may select your own 100 subtractive
 * values by calling:
 *
 *      srand(mat100)
 *
 * and avoid using my magic numbers.  The randreseed64 process is NOT
 * applied to the matrix values. Of course, you must pick good subtractive
 * 100 values yourself!
 *
 * One might object to the complexity of the seed scramble/mapping
 * via the randreseed64() function.  The randreseed64() function maps:
 *
 *      0 ==> 0
 *      10239951819489363767 ==> 1363042948800878693
 *
 * so that srand(0) does the default action and randreseed64() remains
 * an 1-to-1 and onto map.  Thus calling srand(0) with the randreseed64()
 * process would be the same as calling srand(4967126403401436567) without
 * it.  No extra security is gained or reduced by using the randreseed64()
 * process.  The meaning of seeds are exchanged, but not lost or favored
 * (used by more than one input seed).

/*
 * randreseed64 - scramble seed in 64 bit chunks
 *
 * given:
 *      a seed
 *
 * returns:
 *      a scrambled seed, or 0 if seed was 0
 *
 * It is 'nice' when a seed of "n" produces a 'significantly different'
 * sequence than a seed of "n+1".  Generators, by convention, assign
 * special significance to the seed of '0'.  It is an unfortunate that
 * people often pick small seed values, particularly when large seed
 * are of significance to the generators found in this file.
 *
 * We will process seed 64 bits at a time until the entire seed has been
 * exhausted.  If a 64 bit chunk is 0, then 0 is returned.  If the 64 bit
 * chunk is non-zero, we will produce a different and unique new scrambled
 * chunk.  In particular, if the seed is 0 we will return 0.  If the seed
 * is non-zero, we will return a different value (though chunks of 64
 * zeros will remain zero).  This scrambling will effectively eliminate
 * the human perceptions that are noted above.
 *
 * It should be noted that the purpose of this process is to scramble a seed
 * ONLY.  We do not care if these generators produce good random numbers.
 * We only want to help eliminate the human factors and perceptions
 * noted above.
 *
 * This function scrambles all 64 bit chunks of a seed, by mapping [0,2^64)
 * into [0,2^64).  This map is one-to-one and onto.  Mapping is performed
 * using  a linear congruence generator of the form:
 *
 *              X1 <-- (a*X0 + c) % m
 *
 * with the exception that:
 *
 *              0 ==> 0                 (so that srand(0) acts as default)
 *              randreseed64() is an 1-to-1 and onto map
 *
 * The generator are based on the linear congruential generators found in
 * Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming - Seminumerical Algorithms",
 * vol 2, 2nd edition (1981), Section 3.6, pages 170-171.
 *
 * Because we process 64 bits we will take:
 *
 *              m = 2^64                        (based on note ii)
 *
 * We will scan the Rand Book of Random Numbers to look for an 'a' such that:
 *
 *              a mod 8 == 5                    (based on note iii)
 *              0.01*m < a < 0.99*m             (based on note iv)
 *              0.01*2^64 < a < 0.99*2^64
 *
 * To help keep the generators independent, we want:
 *
 *              a is prime
 *
 * The choice of an adder 'c' is considered immaterial according (based
 * in note v).  Knuth suggests 'c==1' or 'c==a'.  We elect to select 'c'
 * using the same process as we used to select 'a'.  The choice is
 * 'immaterial' after all, and as long as:
 *
 *              gcd(c, m) == 1          (based on note v)
 *              gcd(c, 2^64) == 1
 *
 * the concerns are met.   It can be shown that if we have:
 *
 *              gcd(a, c) == 1
 *
 * then the adders and multipliers will be more independent.
 *
 * We will obtain the values 'a' and 'c for our generator from the
 * Rand Book of Random Numbers.  Because m=2^64 is 20 decimal digits long,
 * we will search the Rand Book of Random Numbers 20 at a time.  We will
 * skip any of the 100 values that were used to initialize the subtractive 100
 * generators.  The values obtained from the Rand Book of Random Numbers are:
 *
 *              a = 6316878969928993981
 *              c = 1363042948800878693
 *
 * As we stated before, we must map 0 ==> 0.  The linear congruence
 * generator would normally map as follows:
 *
 *      0 ==> 1363042948800878693       (0 ==> c)
 *
 * We can determine which 0<=y<m will produce a given value z by inverting the
 * linear congruence generator:
 *
 *      z = (a*y + c) % m
 *
 *      z = a*y % m + c % m
 *
 *      z-c % m = a*y % m
 *
 *      (z-c % m) * minv(a,m) = (a*y % m) * minv(a,m)
 *              [minv(a,m) is the multiplicative inverse of a % m]
 *
 *      ((z-c % m) * minv(a,m)) % m = ((a*y % m) * minv(a,m)) % m
 *
 *      ((z-c % m) * minv(a,m)) % m = y % m
 *              [a % m * minv(a,m) = 1 % m by definition]
 *
 *      ((z-c) * minv(a,m)) % m = y % m
 *
 *      ((z-c) * minv(a,m)) % m = y
 *              [we defined y to be 0<=y<m]
 *
 * To determine which value maps back into 0, we let z = 0 and compute:
 *
 *      ((0-c) * minv(a,m)) % m ==> 10239951819489363767
 *
 * and thus we find that the congruence generator would also normally map:
 *
 *      10239951819489363767 ==> 0
 *
 * To overcome this, and preserve the 1-to-1 and onto map, we force:
 *
 *      0 ==> 0
 *      10239951819489363767 ==> 1363042948800878693
 *
 * To repeat, this function converts a values into a seed value.  With the
 * except of 'seed == 0', every value is mapped into a unique seed value.
 * This mapping need not be complex, random or secure.  All we attempt
 * to do here is to allow humans who pick small or successive seed values
 * to obtain reasonably different sequences from the generators below.
 *
 * NOTE: This is NOT a pseudo random number generator.  This function is
 *       intended to be used internally by ss100rand() and sshufrand().

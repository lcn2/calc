    norm - calculate a norm of a value

SYNOPSIS
    norm(x)

TYPES
    If x is an object of type xx, the function xx_norm has to have been

    For non-object x:

    x           number (real or complex)

    return      real

         x^2.

    For complex x, norm(x) returns:

        re(x)^2 + im(x)^2.

EXAMPLE
    ; print norm(3.4), norm(-3.4), norm(3 + 4i), norm(4 - 5i)
    11.56 11.56 25 41

LIMITS

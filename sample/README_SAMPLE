test_random
-----------

    Generate random bits using the Blum-Blum-Shub generator that
    is used by the random() and srandom() builtin functions.

    This prog uses the 10th compiled in Blum modulus.

    This routine makes use of some of the lib_util.c routines.

    usage:

	test_random [bitlen [seed_string]]

	bitlen		number of random bits to generate (default: 128 bits)
	seed_string	seed using this ASCII string (default: use default seed)


many_random
-----------

    Generate many (100000) sets random bits using the Blum-Blum-Shub
    generator that is used by the random() and srandom() builtin functions.

    Output is one set per line.	 Unlike test_random, the seed is not
    printed.  There is no leading 0x on numbers and there is no prefix
    strings.  The only thing printed (normally) is ASCII hex chars and
    newlines.

    Unlike test_random, this prog will execute for a while.  It is
    useful to watch the process size in order to determine of there
    is a memory leak.

    This prog uses the 1st compiled in Blum modulus.

    This routine makes use of some of the lib_util.c routines.

    usage:

	many_random [bitlen [seed_string]]

	bitlen		number of random bits per line set (default: 128 bits)
	seed_string	seed using this ASCII string (default: use default seed)

NAME
    calclevel - current calculation level

SYNOPSIS
    calclevel()

TYPES
    return      nonnegative integer

DESCRIPTION
    This function returns the calculation level at which it is called.
    When a command is being read from a terminal or from a file,
    calc is at calculation level zero.  The level is increased
    by 1 each time calculation starts of a user-defined function
    or of eval(S) for some expression S which evaluates to a string.  It
    decreases to zero if an error occurs or a quit or abort statement
    is executed.  Otherwise, it decreases by 1 when the calculation
    is completed.  Except when an error occurs or abort is executed,
    the input level is not affected by changes in the calculation level.

    Zero calculation level is also called top calculation level; greater
    values of calclevel() indicate calculation is occurring at greater
    depths.

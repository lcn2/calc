Custom calc resource files
--------------------------

The following custom calc resource files are provided because they serve
as examples of how use the custom interface.  The custom interface
allows for machine dependent and/or non-portable code to be added as
built-ins to the calc program.  A few example custom functions and
resource files are shipped with calc to provide you with examples.

By default, the custom builtin returns an error.  Calc have been
built with:

        ALLOW_CUSTOM= -DCUSTOM

in the top level Makefile (this is the shipped default) and calc
must be invoked with a -C argument:

        calc -C

when it is run.

To disable custom even if -C is given, calc must be built with:

        ALLOW_CUSTOM="-UCUSTOM"

See the ../cal/README or "help resource" for information about
calc resource standards and guidelines.

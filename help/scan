NAME
   scan - scan standard input for possible assignment to variables

SYNOPSIS
   scan(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)

TYPES
    x_1, x_2, ...       any

    return              integer

DESCRIPTION
   When input is from a terminal, execution is halted and input is read
   until a newline is entered.  Strings of non-whitespace characters
   are evaluated in succession and if the corresponding x_i is an lvalue,
   the resulting value is assigned to x_i.  If the number of strings
   read exceeds n, only the first n strings are evaluated.  If the number
   of strings is less than n, the later x_i are ignored.

EXAMPLE
    ; global a, b, c, d;
    ; scan(a, 0, c, d)
    ; 2+3    b=a^2        3+4i     3+"a"
    ; print a,b,c,d
        5 25 3+4i Error E_ADD

LIMITS
    The number of arguments is not to exceed 1024.

LINK LIBRARY
    int scanfstr(char *str, char *fmt, int count, VALUE **vals);

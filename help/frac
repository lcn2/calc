NAME
    frac - return the fractional part of a number or of numbers in a value

SYNOPSIS
    frac(x)

TYPES
    If x is an object of type xx, frac(x) requires xx_frac to have been
    defined; other conditions on x and the value returned depend on
    the definition of xx_frac.

    For other x:

    x           number (real or complex), matrix

    return      number or matrix

DESCRIPTION
    If x is an integer, frac(x) returns zero.  For other real values of x,
    frac(x) returns the real number f for which x = i + f, where i is an
    integer, sgn(f) = sgn(x), and abs(f) < 1.

    If x is complex, frac(x) returns frac(re(x)) + frac(im(x))*1i.

    If x is a matrix, frac(x) returns the matrix m with the same structure
    as x in which m[[i]] = frac(x[[i]]).

EXAMPLE
    ; c = config("mode", "frac")
    ; print frac(3), frac(22/7), frac(27/7), frac(-3.125), frac(2.15 - 3.25i)
    0 1/7 6/7 -1/8 3/20-1i/4

LIMITS
    none

LINK LIBRARY

    COMPLEX *c_frac(COMPLEX *x)
    MATRIX *matfrac(MATRIX *x)

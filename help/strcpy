NAME
    strcpy - copy head or all of a string to head or all of a string

SYNOPSIS
    strcpy(s1, s2)

TYPES
    s1		string
    s2		string

    return	string

DESCRIPTION
    Let n1 = size(s1), n2 = size(n2), and m = min(n1, n2).
    This function replaces the first m characters of s1 by the first
    m characters of s2, and if m < n1, replaces the next character of
    s1 by '\0'. The size of s1 and any later characters of s1 are unchanged.
    s1, with its new value, is returned.
    Unlike the C Library function with the same name, this function does
    not require n1 to be greater than or equal to n2, but if this is so,
    normal printing of the returned value will give the same result as
    normal printing of s2.

EXAMPLE
    strcpy("", "xyz") == ""
    strcpy("a", "xyz") == "x"
    strcpy("ab", "xyz") == "xy"
    strcpy("abc", "xyz") == "xyz"
    strcpy("abcd", "xyz") == "xyz\0"
    strcpy("abcde", "xyz") == "xyz\0e"
    strcpy("abcdef", "xyz") == "xyz\0ef"
    strcpy("abc", "") == "\0bc"

LIMITS
    none

LINK LIBRARY
    STRING* stringcpy(STRING *s1, STRING *s2)

NAME
    feof - determine if end-of-file flag is set

SYNOPSIS
    feof(fd)

TYPES
    fd          file stream open for reading

    return      0 or 1

DESCRIPTION
    The function feof(fd) returns 1 or 0 according as the end-of-file flag
    is set or clear.

    The end-of-file flag for the stream fd is set if reading at the
    end-of-file position is attempted.  The flag is cleared by
    positioning operations (fseek, rewind, fsetpos) and by freopen.

EXAMPLE
    ; fd1 = fopen("/tmp/newfile", "w")
    ; fputs(fd1, "Chongo was here\n")
    ; fflush(fd1)
    ; fd2 = fopen("/tmp/newfile", "r")
    ; feof(fd2)
            0
    ; fgetline(fd2)
            "Chongo was here"
    ; feof(fd2)
            0
    ; fgetline(fd2)
    ; feof(fd2)

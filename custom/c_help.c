 * c_help - custom help function
 *
 * This function assumes that a help file with the same name as
 * the custom function has been installed by the custom/Makefile
 * (as listed in the CUSTOM_HELP makefile variable) under the
 * CUSTOMHELPDIR == HELPDIR/custhelp directory.
 *
 * The help command first does a search in HELPDIR and later
 * in CUSTOMHELPDIR.  If a custom help file has the same name
 * as a file under HELPDIR then help will display the HELPDIR
 * file and NOT the custom file.  This function will ignore
 * and HELPDIR file and work directly with the custom help file.
 *
 * given:
 *	vals[0]	   name of the custom help file to directly access

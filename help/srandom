DESCRIPTION
    Seed the pseudo-random number using the Blum-Blum-Shub generator.

    There are two primary values contained inside generator state:

	Blum modulus:

		A product of two primes.  Each prime is 3 mod 4.

	Quadratic residue:

		Some integer squared modulo the Blum modulus.

    Seeding the generator involves changing the Quadratic residue
    and in most cases the Blum modulus as well.

    In addition to the two primary values values, an internal buffer of
    unused random output is kept.  When the generator is seeded, any
    buffered random output is tossed.

    In each of the following cases, srandom returns the previous state
    of the generator.  Depending on what args are supplied, a new
    generator state is established.  The exception is the no-arg state.

    0 args:				srandom()

	Returns the current generator state.  Unlike all of the other
	srandom calls, this call does not modify the generator, nor
	does it flush the internal bits.

    1 arg (state arg):			srandom(state)

	sets the generator to 'state', where 'state' is a previous
	return of srandom().

    1 arg (0 seed):			srandom(0)

	Sets the generator to the initial startup state.  This a
	call of srandom(0) will restore the generator to the state
	found when calc starts.

    1 arg (seed >= 2^32):		srandom(21609139158123209^9+17)

	The seed value is used to compute the new quadratic residue.
	The seed passed will be successively squared mod the Blum
	modulus until we get a smaller value (modulus wrap).  The
	calc resource file produces an equivalent effect:

		/* assume n is the current Blum modulus */
		r = seed;
		do {
			last_r = r;
			r = pmod(r, 2, n);
		} while (r > last_r);
		/* r is the new Quadratic residue */

	In this form of srandom, the Blum modulus is not changed.

	NOTE: [1,2^32) seed values and seed<0 values
	      are reserved for future use.

    2 args (seed, newn>=2^32):		srandom(seed, newn)

	The newn value is used as the new Blum modulus.	 This modulus
	is assumed to be a product of two primes that are both 3 mod
	4.  The newn value is not factored, it is only checked to see
	if it is 1 mod 4.

	In this call form, newn value must be >= 2^32.

	The seed arg is used to establish the initial quadratic value
	once newn has been made the Blum moduli.  The seed must
	be either 0 or >= 2^32.	 If seed == 0, the initial quadratic
	residue used with srandom(0) is used with the new Blum moduli.
	If seed >= 2^32, then srandom(seed, newn) has the same effect as:

		srandom(0, newn);    /* set Blum modulus & def quad res */
		srandom(seed);	     /* set quadratic residue */

	Use of newn values that are not the product of two 3 mod 4
	primes will result in a non-cryptographically strong generator.
	While the generator will produce values, their quality will
	be suspect.

	The period of the generator determines how many bits will
	be produced before it repeats.	The period is determined
	by the Blum modulus.  Some newn values (that are a product
	of two 3 mod 4 primes) can produce a generator with a
	very short period making is useless for most applications.

	When Blum modulus is p*q, the period of a generator is:

	    lcm(factors of p-1 and q-1)

	One can construct a generator with a maximal period when 'p'
	and 'q' have the fewest possible factors in common.  The
	quickest way to select such primes is only use 'p' and 'q' when
	'(p-1)/2' and '(q-1)/2' are both primes.  Assuming that
	fp=(p-1)/2, fq=(q-1)/2, p and q are all primes 3 mod 4, the
	period of the generator is the longest possible:

	    lcm(factors of p-1 and q-1) == lcm(2,fp,2,fq) = 2*fp*fq = ~n/2

	The following calc resource file:

	    /* find first Blum prime: p */
	    fp = int((ip-1)/2);
	    do {
		do {
		    fp = nextcand(fp+2, 1, 0, 3, 4);
		    p = 2*fp+1;
		} while (ptest(p, 1, 0) == 0);
	    } while (ptest(p, trials) == 0 || ptest(fp, trials));

	    /* find second Blum prime: q */
	    fq = int((iq-1)/2);
	    do {
		do {
		    fq = nextcand(fq+2, 1, 0, 3, 4);
		    q = 2*fq+1;
		} while (ptest(q, 1, 0) == 0);
	    } while (ptest(q, trials) == 0 || ptest(fq, trials));

	    /* seed the generator */
	    srandom(ir, p*q);

	Where:
	    ip
		initial search location for the Blum prime 'p'
	    iq
		initial search location for the Blum prime 'q'
	    ir
		initial Blum quadratic residue generator.  The 'ir'
		must be 0 or >= 2^32, preferably large some random
		value < p*q.  The following may be useful to set ir:

			srand(p+q);
			ir = randbit(highbit(p)+highbit(q))
	    trials
		number of pseudo prime tests that a candidate must pass
		before being considered a probable prime (must be >0, try 25)

	The calc standard resource file seedrandom.cal will produce a
	seed a generator.  If the config value custom("resource_debug")
	is 0 or 1, then the selected Blum modulus and quadratic residue
	will be printed.  If the global value is 1, then p and q are
	also printed.  The resource file defines the function:

		seedrandom(seed1, seed2, size [, trials])

	Where:
	    seed1
		A random number >= 10^20 and perhaps < 10^93.
	    seed2
		A random number >= 10^20 and perhaps < 10^93.
	    size
		Minimal Blum modulus size in bits,  This must be >= 32.
		A value of 512 might be a good choice.
	    trials
		number of pseudo prime tests that a candidate must pass
		before being considered a probable prime (must be >0, try 25).
		Using the default value of 25 might be a good choice.

	Unfortunately finding optimal values can be very slow for large
	values of 'p' and 'q'.	On a 200Mhz r4k, it can take as long as
	1 minute at 512 bits, and 5 minutes at 1024 bits.

	For the sake of speed, you may want to use to use one of the
	pre-compiled in Blum moduli via the [1
	If you don't want to use a pre-compiled in Blum moduli you can
	compute your own values ahead of time.	This can be done by a
	method of your own choosing, or by using the seedrandom.cal
	resource file in the following way:

	    1) calc			   # run calc
	    2) read seedrandom		   # load seedrandom
	    3) config("resource_debug",0)  # we want the modulus & quad res only
	    4) seedrandom( ~pound out 20-93 random digits on the keyboard~,
			   ~pound out 20-93 random digits on the keyboard~,
			   512 )
	    5) save the seed and newn values for later use

	NOTE: [1,2^32) seed values, seed<0 values, [21,2^32) newn values
	      and newn<=0 values are reserved for future use.

    2 args (seed, 1>=newn>=20):		srandom(seed, newn)

	The newn is used to select one of 20 pre-computed Blum moduli.

	The seed arg is used to establish the initial quadratic value
	once newn has been made the Blum moduli.  The seed must be
	either 0 or >= 2^32.  If seed == 0, the pre-compiled quadratic
	residue for the given newn is selected.	 If seed >= 2^32, then
	srandom(seed, newn) has the same effect as:

		srandom(0, newn);    /* set Blum modulus & def quad res */
		srandom(seed);	     /* set quadratic residue */

	Note that unlike the newn>=2^32 case, a seed if 0 uses the
	pre-compiled quadratic residue for the selected pre-compiled
	Blum moduli.

	The pre-defined Blum moduli and quadratic residues were selected
	by LavaRnd, a hardware random number generator.  See the URL:

	    http://www.LavaRnd.org/

	for an explanation of how the LavaRnd random number generator works.
	For more information, see the comments at the top of the calc
	source file, zrandom.c.

	The purpose of these pre-defined Blum moduli is to provide users with
	an easy way to use a generator where the individual Blum primes used
	are not well known.  True, these values are in some way "MAGIC", on
	the other hand that is their purpose!  If this bothers you, don't
	use them.

	The value 'newn' determines which pre-defined generator is used.

	    newn ==  1: (Blum modulus bit length 130)
	    newn ==  2: (Blum modulus bit length 137)
	    newn ==  3: (Blum modulus bit length 147)
	    newn ==  4: (Blum modulus bit length 157)
	    newn ==  5: (Blum modulus bit length 257)
	    newn ==  6: (Blum modulus bit length 259)
	    newn ==  7: (Blum modulus bit length 286)
	    newn ==  8: (Blum modulus bit length 294)
	    newn ==  9: (Blum modulus bit length 533)
	    newn == 10: (Blum modulus bit length 537)
	    newn == 11: (Blum modulus bit length 542)
	    newn == 12: (Blum modulus bit length 549)
	    newn == 13: (Blum modulus bit length 1048)
	    newn == 14: (Blum modulus bit length 1054)
	    newn == 15: (Blum modulus bit length 1055)
	    newn == 16: (Blum modulus bit length 1062)
	    newn == 17: (Blum modulus bit length 2062)
	    newn == 18: (Blum modulus bit length 2074)
	    newn == 19: (Blum modulus bit length 2133)
	    newn == 20: (Blum modulus bit length 2166)

	See the comments near the top of the source file, zrandom.c, for the
	actual pre-compiled values.

	The Blum moduli associated with 1 <= newn < 9 are subject
	to having their Blum moduli factored, depending in their size,
	by small PCs in a reasonable to large supercomputers/highly
	parallel processors over a long time.  Their value lies in their
	speed relative the the default Blum generator.	As of Feb 1997,
	the Blum moduli associated with 13 <= newn < 20 appear to
	be well beyond the scope of hardware and algorithms,
	and 9 <= newn < 12 might be factorable with extreme difficulty.

	The following table may be useful as a guide for how easy it
	is to factor the modulus:

	     1 <= newn <= 4   PC using ECM in a short amount of time
	     5 <= newn <= 8   Workstation using MPQS in a short amount of time
	     8 <= newn <= 12  High end supercomputer or high parallel processor
			      using state of the art factoring over a long time
	    12 <= newn <= 16  Beyond Feb 1997 systems and factoring methods
	    17 <= newn <= 20  Well beyond Feb 1997 systems and factoring methods

	In other words, use of newn == 9, 10, 11 and 12 is likely to
	work just fine for all but the truly paranoid.

	NOTE: [1,2^32) seed values, seed<0 values, [21,2^32) newn values
	      and newn<=0 values are reserved for future use.

    4 args (seed, ip>=2^16, iq>=2^16, trials):	srandom(seed, ip, iq, 25)

	The 'ip' and 'iq' args are used to find simples prime 3 mod 4

	The call srandom(seed, ip, iq, trials) has the same effect as:

	    srandom(seed,
		    nextcand(ip, trials,0, 3,4)*nextcand(iq, trials,0, 3,4));

	Note that while the newn is very likely to be a product of
	two primes both 3 mod 4, there is no guarantee that the period
	of the generator will be long.	The likelihood is that the
	period will be long, however.  See one of the 2 arg srandom
	calls above for more information on this issue.

	NOTE: [1,2^32) seed values, seed<0 values, [21,2^32) newn values,
	      newn<=0 values, ip<2^16 and iq<2^16 are reserved for future use.

    See the random help file for details on the generator.

NAME
    dm2d, dms2d - convert degrees, minutes, and seconds to degrees

SYNOPSIS
    dm2d(d, m [,rnd])
    dms2d(d, m, s [,rnd])

TYPES
    d           real
    m           real
    s           real (defaults to 0)
    rnd         nonnegative integer, defaults to config("mod")

    return      degrees

DESCRIPTION
    Convert degrees, m minutes, and s seconds returning degrees.

    The return value in degrees, is equivalent to the following:

        mod(d + m/60 + s/3600, 360, rnd);

    Depending on the rounding mode, the return could be a real value
    in the interval [0, 360) or a real value in the interval (-360, 0].
    For the default round mode, the return value is in the interval [0, 360).

    A missing rnd defaults to config("mod").
    For more information on the effects of rnd, see "help mod".

    The dm2d(d, m, rnd) builtin is an alias for dms2d(d, m, 0, rnd).

EXAMPLE
    ; print dm2d(203, 325.5594);
    208.42599
    ; print dm2d(3601, -25.5594);
    0.57401
    ; print dm2d(-923, -25.5594);
    156.57401

    ; print dms2d(12, 20, 44.16);
    12.3456
    ; print dms2d(123.456, -345.68, 4.08);
    117.6958
    ; print dms2d(-65, -40, -44.4);
    294.321

    ; print dm2d(203, 325.5594, 1);
    -151.57401

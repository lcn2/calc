NAME
    meq - test for equality modulo a specified number

SYNOPSIS
    meq(x, y, md)

TYPES
    x		real
    y		real
    md		real

    return	0 or 1

DESCRIPTION
    Returns 1 if and only if for some integer n, x - y = n * md, i.e.
    x is congruent to y modulo md.

    If md = 0, this is equivalent to x == y.

    For any x, y, md, meq(x, y, md) = ismult(x - y, md).

EXAMPLE
    ; print meq(5, 33, 7), meq(.05, .33, -.07), meq(5, 32, 7)

NAME
    gd - Gudermannian function

SYNOPSIS
    gd(z [,eps])

TYPES
    z		number (real or complex)
    eps		nonzero real, defaults to epsilon()

    return	number or "Log of zero or infinity" error value

DESCRIPTION
    Calculate the Gudermannian of z to a multiple of eps with errors in
    real and imaginary parts less in absolute value than .75 * eps,
    or return an error value if z is close to one of the branch points
    at odd multiples of (pi/2) * i.

    gd(z) is usually defined initially for real z by one of the formulae

		gd(z) = 2 * atan(exp(z)) - pi/2

		      = 2 * atan(tanh(z/2))

		      = atan(sinh(z)),

    or as the integral from 0 to z of (1/cosh(t))dt.  For complex z, the
    principal branch, approximated by gd(z, eps), has the cut:
    re(z) = 0, abs(im(z)) >= pi/2; on the cut calc takes gd(z) to be
    the limit as z is approached from the right or left according as
    im(z) > or < 0.

    If z = x + y*i and abs(y) < pi/2, gd(z) is given by

	gd(z) = atan(sinh(x)/cos(y)) + i * atanh(sin(y)/cosh(x)).

EXAMPLE
    ; print gd(1, 1e-5), gd(1, 1e-10), gd(1, 1e-15)
    .86577 .8657694832 .865769483239659

    ; print gd(2+1i, 1e-5), gd(2+1i, 1e-10)
    1.42291+.22751i 1.4229114625+.2275106584i

LIMITS
    none

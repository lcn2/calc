Dear calc user,

See the HOWTO.INSTALL file for information on how to build and install calc.

To be sure that your version of calc is up to date, check out:

        http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/calc/calc-download.html

We are interested in any/all feedback on recent versions of calc.
In particular we would like to hear about:

    * compiler warnings
    * compile problems
    * regression test problems (try: make check)
    * special compile flags/options that you needed
    * Makefile problems
    * help file problems
    * misc nits and typos

We would like to offer a clean compile across a wide verity of platforms,
so if you can test on several, so much the better!

If you run into problems, see the BUGS file.

Calc is distributed with an extensive collection of help files that
are accessible from the command line.  The following assume that you
are running calc from the distribution directory or that you have
installed calc.  In these examples, the "; " is the calc prompt, not
something that you type in.

For list of help topics:

    ; help

For overview of calc overview:

    ; help intro
    ; help overview
    ; help command
    ; help define
    ; help statement
    ; help variable
    ; help usage

For list of builtin functions:

    ; help builtin

C programmers should note some unexpected differences with the calc syntax:

    ; help unexpected

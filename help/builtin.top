Builtin functions

        There is a large number of built-in functions.  Many of the
        functions work on several types of arguments, whereas some only
        work for the correct types (e.g., numbers or strings).  In the
        following description, this is indicated by whether or not the
        description refers to values or numbers.  This display is generated
        by the 'show builtin' command.

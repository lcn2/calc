NAME
    blkfree - free memory allocated to named block

SYNOPSIS
    blkfree(val)

TYPES
    val         named block, string, or integer

    return      null value

DESCRIPTION
    If val is a named block, or the name of a named block, or the
    identifying index for a named block, blkfree(val) frees the
    memory block allocated to this named block.  The block remains
    in existence with the same name, identifying index, and chunksize,
    but its size and maxsize becomes zero and the pointer for the start
    of its data block null.

    A new block of memory may be allocated to a freed block B by
    blk(B [, len, chunk]), len defaulting to zero and chunk to the
    chunksize when the block was freed.

EXAMPLE

    ; B1 = blk("foo")
    ; B2 = blk("Second block")
    show blocks
     id   name
    ----  -----
     0   foo
     1   Second block

    ; blkfree(B1)
    ; show blocks
     id   name
    ----  -----
     1   Second block

    ; B1
        block 0: foo
        chunksize = 256, maxsize = 0, datalen = 0
        NULL

    ; blk(B1); B[7] = 5
    ; B1
        block 0: foo
        chunksize = 256, maxsize = 256, datalen = 8

NAME
    d2dm - convert degrees into degrees, and minutes

SYNOPSIS
    d2dm(degs, d, m [,rnd])

TYPES
    degs        real
    d           null-or-real-valued lvalue with assign-to permission
    m           null-or-real-valued lvalue with assign-to permission
    rnd         nonnegative integer, defaults to config("mod")

    return      mod(degs, 360, rnd)

DESCRIPTION
    Convert degs degrees into d degrees, and m minutes.

    The return value is a normalized number of degrees, and is equivalent
    to the following:

        return_value = mod(degs, 360, rnd);

    The argument rnd, if not given, defaults to config("mod").
    For more information on the effects of rnd, see "help mod".

    Depending on the rounding mode, the return could be a real value
    in the interval [0, 360) or a real value in the interval (-360, 0].
    For the default round mode, the return value is in the interval [0, 360).

    The d argument will be an integer number of degrees.

    The value d will be set as if the following were used:

        d = int(return_value);

    For some rounding modes, d will be an integer in the interval [0, 360).
    For other rounding modes, d will be an integer in the interval (-360, 0].
    For the default round mode, d is in the interval [0, 360).

    The m argument will be a real number of minutes.

    The value m will be set as if the following were used:

        tmp = return_value - d;
        m = tmp * 60;
        free(tmp);

    For some rounding modes, m will be a real value in the interval [0, 60).
    For other rounding modes, m will be a real value in the interval (-60, 0].
    For the default round mode, m will be in the interval [0, 60).

    The following shows relationship between the return value and the resulting
    d, and m values:

        return_value == d + m/60;

EXAMPLE
    ; ## if args are undefined, pre-declare them or assign them as args

    ; global d, m;

    ; print d2dm(12.3456,d,m), d, m;
    12.3456 12 20.736
    ; print d2dm(1234.5678,d,m), d, m;
    154.5678 154 34.068
    ; print d2dm(-1234.5678,d,m), d, m;
    205.4322 205 25.932

    ; print d2dm(654.321,deg=,min=), deg, min;
    294.321 294 19.26
    ; print d2dm(-654.321,deg=,min=), deg, min;
    65.679 65 40.74
    ; print d2dm(360.321,deg=,min=), deg, min;
    0.321 0 19.26

    ; ## certain non-default rounding modes can return negative values

    ; print d2dm(654.321,deg=,min=,1), deg, min;
    -65.679 -65 -40.74
    ; print d2dm(-654.321,deg=,min=,1), deg, min;
    -294.321 -294 -19.26
    ; print d2dm(360.321,deg=,min=,1), deg, min;
    -359.679 -359 -40.74

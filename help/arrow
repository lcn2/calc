SYMBOL and NAME
    ->  - arrow operator

SYNOPSIS
    p -> X

TYPES
    p           pointer to an lvalue
    X           identifier

    return      lvalue

DESCRIPTION
    p->X returns the same as (*p).X.  Thus the current value of *p is
    to be an object of a type for which X identifies one element.
    p->X then returns the lvalue corresponding to that element of the
    value of *p.

    The expression *p.X will cause a runtime error since this is
    interpreted as *(p.X) in which p is expected to be an object of
    an appropriate type.

    Spaces or tabs on either side of -> are optional.

EXAMPLE
    ; obj pair {one, two}
    ; obj pair A; obj pair B
    ; p = &A
    ; p->one = 1; p->two = 2
    ; A
        obj pair {1, 2}

    ; A->two = &B
    ; p->one = 3; p->two = 4

    ; *p
            obj pair {3, 4}

    ; B = {5,6}
    ; *p->two
            4

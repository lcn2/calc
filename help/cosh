NAME
    cosh - hyperbolic cosine

SYNOPSIS
    cosh(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x           real
    eps         0 < real < 1, defaults to epsilon()

    return      real

DESCRIPTION
    Calculate the cosh of x to the nearest or next to nearest multiple of
    epsilon, with absolute error less than .75 * eps.

    cosh(x) = (exp(x) + exp(-x))/2

EXAMPLE
    ; print cosh(1, 1e-5), cosh(1, 1e-10), cosh(1, 1e-15), cosh(1, 1e-20)
    1.54308 1.5430806348 1.543080634815244 1.54308063481524377848

LIMITS
    0 < eps < 1

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qcosh(NUMBER *x, NUMBER *eps)

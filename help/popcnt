TYPES
    x           number (real or integer)
    bitval      0 or 1

    bitval is 1 which counts the number of 1 bits.

    The popcnt function is equivalent to #x when x is an integer.

EXAMPLE
    ; print popcnt(32767), popcnt(3/2), popcnt(pi(),0), popcnt(pi(),1)
    15 3 69 65

    ; print popcnt(randombit(128), 0), popcnt(randombit(128), 1)
    61 64

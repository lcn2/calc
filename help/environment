Environment variables

    CALCPATH

	A :-separated list of directories used to search for
	resource filenames (*.cal files) that do not begin with
	/, ./ or ~.

	If this variable does not exist, a compiled value
	is used.  Typically compiled in value is:

		    .:./cal:~/cal:${CALC_SHAREDIR}:${CUSTOMCALDIR}

	which is usually:

		    .:./cal:~/cal:/usr/share/calc:/usr/share/calc/custom

	This value is used by the READ command.	 It is an error
	if no such readable file is found.

	The CALCBINDINGS file searches the CALCPATH as well.


    CALCRC

	On startup (unless -h or -q was given on the command
	line), calc searches for files along the :-separated
	$CALCRC environment variable.

	If this variable does not exist, a compiled value
	is used.  Typically compiled in value is:

		    ${CALC_SHAREDIR}/startup:~/.calcrc:./.calcinit

	which is usually:

		    /usr/share/calc/startup:~/.calcrc:./.calcinit

	Missing files along the $CALCRC path are silently ignored.

    CALCBINDINGS

	On startup (unless -h or -q was given on the command
	line), calc reads key bindings from the filename specified
	in the $CALCRC environment variable.  These key bindings
	are used for command line editing and the command history.

	If this variable does not exist, a compiled value is used.
	Typically compiled in value is:

		    bindings

	The bindings file is searched along the CALCPATH.  Unlike
	the READ command, a .cal extension is not added.

	If the file could not be opened, or if standard input is not
	a terminal, then calc will still run, but fancy command line
	editing is disabled.

	NOTE: If calc was compiled with GNU-readline support, the
	      CALCBINDINGS facility is ignored and the standard
	      readline mechanisms (see readline(3)) are used.

    HOME

	This value is taken to be the home directory of the
	current user.  It is used when files begin with '~/'.

	If this variable does not exist, the home directory password
	entry of the current user is used.  If that information
	is not available, '.' is used.

    PAGER

	When invoking help, this environment variable is used
	to display a help file.

	If this variable does not exist, a compiled value
	is used.  Typically compiled in value is something
	such as 'more', 'less', 'pg' or 'cat'.

    SHELL

	When a !-command is used, the program indicated by
	this environment variable is used.

	If this variable does not exist, a compiled value
	is used.  Typically compiled in value is something
	such as 'sh' is used.

NAME
    errcount - return or set the internal error count

SYNOPSIS
    errcount([num])

TYPES
    num		integer

    return	integer

DESCRIPTION
    An internal variable keeps count of the number of functions
    evaluating to an error value either internally or by a call to
    error() or newerror().

    The errcount() with no args returns the current error count.  Calling
    errcount(num) returns the current error count and resets it to num.

    If the count exceeds the current value of errmax, execution is aborted
    with a message displaying the errno for the error.

    If an error value is assigned to a variable as in:

			infty = 1/0;

    then a function returning that variable does not contribute to
    errcount.

EXAMPLE
    ; errmax(10)
	    0
    ; errcount()
	    0
    ; a = 1/0; b = 2 + ""; c = error(27); d = newerror("a");
    ; print errcount(), a, errcount(), errmax();
    4 Error 10001 4 10

LIMITS
    0 <= num < 2^32

LINK LIBRARY
    none

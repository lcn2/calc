NAME
    modify - modify a list or matrix by changing the values of its elements

SYNOPSIS
    modify(A, fname)

TYPES
    A		lvalue with list, matrix or objectvalue
    fname	string, the name of a user-defined function

    return	null value if successful, otherwise an error value

DESCRIPTION
    The value of each element of A is replaced by the value at that
    value of the user-defined function with name fname. Thus,
    modify(A, "f") has the effect of

	for (i = 0; i < size(A); i++) A[[i]] = f(A[[i]]);

    An error value is returned if A is not of acceptable type, if A has
    no-change protection, or if there is no user-defined function with
    name fname. The assignments are executed even if the protection
    status of some elements A[[i]] would normally prevent the
    assignment of f(A[[i]]) to A[[i]]. The modified elements retain
    whatever kinds of protection they had as well as gaining any
    other kinds of protection in the values returned by the function.

    To obtain a modified copy of A without changing values in A,
    one may use

	Amod = A; modify(A, fname)

    or more simply

	modify(Amod = A, fname).

EXAMPLE
    ; define f(x) = x^2
    ; A = list(2,4,6)
    ; modify(A, "f")
    ; print A

    list (3 elements, 3 nonzero):
	  [[0]] = 4
	  [[1]] = 16
	  [[3]] = 36

LIMITS
    none

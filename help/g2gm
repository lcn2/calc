NAME
    g2gm - convert gradians into gradians, and minutes

SYNOPSIS
    g2gm(grads, g, m [,rnd])

TYPES
    grads       real
    g           null-or-real-valued lvalue with assign-to permission
    m           null-or-real-valued lvalue with assign-to permission
    rnd         nonnegative integer, defaults to config("mod")

    return      mod(grads, 400, rnd)

DESCRIPTION
    Convert grads gradians into g gradians, and m minutes.

    The return value is a normalized number of gradians, and is equivalent
    to the following:

        return_value = mod(grads, 400, rnd);

    The argument rnd, if not given, defaults to config("mod").
    For more information on the effects of rnd, see "help mod".

    Depending on the rounding mode, the return could be a real value
    in the interval [0, 400) or a real value in the interval (-400, 0].
    For the default round mode, the return value is in the interval [0, 400).

    The g argument will be an integer number of gradians.

    The value g will be set as if the following were used:

        g = int(return_value);

    For some rounding modes, g will be an integer in the interval [0, 400).
    For other rounding modes, g will be an integer in the interval (-400, 0].
    For the default round mode, g is in the interval [0, 400).

    The m argument will be a real number of minutes.

    The value m will be set as if the following were used:

        tmp = return_value - g;
        m = tmp * 60;
        free(tmp);

    For some rounding modes, m will be a real value in the interval [0, 60).
    For other rounding modes, m will be a real value in the interval (-60, 0].
    For the default round mode, m will be in the interval [0, 60).

    The following shows relationship between the return value and the resulting
    g, and m values:

        return_value == g + m/60;

EXAMPLE
    ; ## if args are undefined, pre-declare them or assign them as args

    ; global g, m;

    ; print g2gm(12.3456,g,m), g, m;
    12.3456 12 20.736
    ; print g2gm(1234.5678,g,m), g, m;
    34.5678 34 34.068
    ; print g2gm(-1234.5678,g,m), g, m;
    365.4322 365 25.932

    ; print g2gm(654.321,grad=,min=), grad, min;
    254.321 254 19.26
    ; print g2gm(-654.321,grad=,min=), grad, min;
    145.679 145 40.74
    ; print g2gm(400.321,grad=,min=), grad, min;
    0.321 0 19.26

    ; ## certain non-default rounding modes can return negative values

    ; print g2gm(654.321,grad=,min=,1), grad, min;
    -145.679 -145 -40.74
    ; print g2gm(-654.321,grad=,min=,1), grad, min;
    -254.321 -254 -19.26
    ; print g2gm(400.321,grad=,min=,1), grad, min;
    -399.679 -399 -40.74

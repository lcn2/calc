NAME
    ltol - "leg to leg", third side of a right-angled triangle with
                unit hypotenuse, given one other side

SYNOPSIS
    ltol(x, [,eps])

TYPES
    x           real
    eps         nonzero real, defaults to epsilon()

    return      real

DESCRIPTION
    Returns sqrt(1 - x^2) to the nearest multiple of eps.
    The default value for eps is epsilon().

EXAMPLE
    ; print ltol(0.4, 1e-6), hypot(0.5, 1e-6)
    0.6 0.866025

LIMITS
    abs(x) <= 1
    eps != 0

LINK LIBRARY

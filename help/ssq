NAME
    ssq - sum of squares

SYNOPSIS
    ssq(x1, x2, ...)

TYPES
    x1, x2, ... lists or values for which required operations are defined

    return      as determined by the operations on x1, x2, ...

DESCRIPTION
    Null values are ignored; ssq() returns the null value.
    If no argument is a list, returns x1^2 + x2^2 + ...
    If an argument = list(t1, t2, ...) it contributes ssq(t1, t2, ...)
        to the result.
EXAMPLE
    ; print ssq(1,2,3), ssq(1+2i, 3-4i, 5 +6i)
    14 -21+40i

    ; mat A[2,2] = {1,2,3,4}; mat B[2,2] = {5,6,7,8}
    ; print ssq(A, B, A + B)

    mat [2,2] (4 elements, 4 nonzero):
      [0,0] = 190
      [0,1] = 232
      [1,0] = 286
      [1,1] = 352

    ; ssq(list(2,3,5),7)
        87

    ; ssq(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)
        204
    ; ssq(1,2, list(3,4,list(5,6)), list(), 7, 8)
        204

LIMITS
    The number of arguments is not to exceed 1024.

/*
 * MAJOR_VER
 *
 *      The MAJOR_VER is 2 is the classical version of calc.
 *
 *      One of the main reasons why MAJOR_VER might incremented is
 *      if fundamental calc data objects (such as when ZVALUE or NUMBER
 *      or COMPLEX need to change) that would cause an incompatibility
 *      with existing hardware accelerators that are using fundamental
 *      calc data objects.
 *
 * MINOR_VER
 *
 *      The MINOR_VER changes when there are incompatible changes to the calc library
 *      or calc custom library.   The MINOR_VER might change if we need to make a major
 *      change to the math engine.  For example, when the way 0^x was evaluated, we
 *      changed MINOR_VER from 13 to 14.
 *
 * MAJOR_PATCH
 *
 *      The MAJOR_PATCH changes when there is an update to the calc library
 *      or calc custom library.  For example, the MAJOR_PATCH might increment when there
 *      are new builtin functions available, or when there is a change to how existing
 *      builtin functions process arguments.
 *
 * MINOR_PATCH
 *
 *      The MINOR_PATCH changes whenever there is any change in the calc release.
 *      For example, when the documentation changes, the MINOR_PATCH will increment.
 *      Moreover, when we are working towards a new production release,
 *      bug fix and improvement updates will cause MINOR_PATCH to increment.

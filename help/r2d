NAME
    r2d - convert radians to degrees

SYNOPSIS
    r2d(x [,eps])

TYPES
    x		number (real or complex)
    eps		0 < real < 1, defaults to epsilon()

    return	number

DESCRIPTION
    Given x radians, return the equivalent number of degrees.

    The eps controls the precision of the calculated internal
    constant pi / 180.

EXAMPLE
    ; pi = pi(1e-20)
    ; print r2d(pi), r2d(pi/3), r2d(2*pi)
    180 60 360

    ; print r2d(pi+4i), r2d(pi/3 + 1i*pi), r2d(pi/5 + 5i*pi)
    180+~229.18311805232928350739i 60+180, 36+900i

LIMITS
    0 < eps < 1

LINK LIBRARY
    NUMBER *qpidiv180(NUMBER *eps)

NAME
    putenv - set the value of an environment variable

SYNOPSIS
    putenv(env [,val])

TYPES
    env         str
    val         str

    return      int

DESCRIPTION
     This function will set or change the value of an environment variable.
     Zero is returned if the environment variable was successfully set,
     otherwise a non-zero result is returned.

     When called with 1 arg, env must be a string of the form:

            "envname=envval"

     This sets the environment variable "envname" to the value "envval".

     The 2 arg form is equivalent to:

            putenv(strcat(env, "=", val))

EXAMPLE
    ; putenv("name", "value")
            0
    ; getenv("name")
            "value"
    ; putenv("name=val2")
            0
    ; getenv("name")
            "val2"
    ; isnull(getenv("unknown"))
            1

LIMITS
    With 1 arg, env must contain at least 1 '=' character.

LINK LIBRARY
    none
